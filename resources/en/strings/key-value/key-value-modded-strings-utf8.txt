Because of its access to the sea, it has a steady food income.\n\n- Corinth (Blue) lies on the isthmus between the Peloponnese and the rest of Greece, which makes it of important strategic value. It fields Riddare and Armborstskyttar. Although it produces mostly wood, it is also known to be an important trade center. Securing that trade will generate gold for the Visigoths.\n\n- The famed city of Athens (Cyan) lies to the northeast of your camp, beyond Corinth, and cannot be reached initially. It is defended by Lätt Kavalleri and Long Fäktare. It is said that there is an important silver mine to the north of it. Although it does not generate as much as it once did, seizing it will incur additional gold tribute from the Athenians.\n\n- Eastern Roman defense forces (Purple) are scattered about Greece to protect it from barbarian raids.

Expect to face Janitsjarer, Tung Camels, Husarer, Kanoner, Galeons and Kanongaleoner.\n\n- To the west, on the Wallachian side of the Danube, Orsova (Yellow) supplies timber to the nearby Turkish troops and to the local towns for shipbuilding. They have a highly mobile army consisting of Magyariska Husarer, Ryttarskyttar, and Riddare.\n\n- East of Giurgiu, Obluciza (Green) is mining the rich stone deposits north of their city. This stone is used by the local towns to fortify themselves against Vlad's raids. Their Bojarer, Archers, and Monks will not be easy to deal with.\n\n- Across the river, in northern Bulgaria, the village of Novoselo (Orange) is known for its fertile farmland. This food is sent directly to the Turkish garrisons. Only defended by Skärmytslare and Lätt Kavalleri, Novoselo is a rather easy target.\n\n- West of Darstor lies the Bulgarian village of Rahova (Cyan), famed for its rich gold mines. Their gold finances all unique units in the region, but most importantly the Janitsjarer in Darstor. The village relies on infanteri for its defense, but if given time it will also build rams and go on the offensive.\n\n- All of Vlad's adversaries will construct warships so long as they have the supplies for them."

There are enough resources in the vicinity of Troia to feed its garrison.\n\n- The north of the map is controlled by the Holy Roman Empire (Red). Because of its excellent siegecraft and powerful infantry, the Holy Roman army is probably your most threatening opponent.\n\n- The Papal States (Green) should also not be underestimated. Expect fierce attacks comprised of archery units and swordsmen. In addition, the Papacy will make use of Murbräckor to assault your Castle.\n\n- In the south is Capua (Blue). This city has remained loyal to Boioannes thus far, but it is possible that the enemy could capture it and force its population to fight against you.\n\n- Rumor has it that some leaderless Norman Mercenaries (Yellow) have camped near the mountains. Perhaps they will assist you—if you are willing to pay them, of course.\n\n- The traitor Melus is no longer a threat, but his brother Dattus (Orange) has sworn to continue the struggle. Dattus' army consists of infantry, mounted skyttar, and Murbräckor.\n\n- To the east is the Abbey of Montecassino (Grey), which is barely defended. Seeing as its Monks support your opponents, there is little reason to spare them."

The army of Waman Karpa is composed of Archers, Murbräckor and infanteri such as Kamajuker and Örnkrigare.\n\n- Andahuaylas (Green) is located in the southwest and will attack early. The city will train Skärmytslare, Slungkastare and Scorpio, but will also build rams if given enough time. In addition, Andahuaylas also has a few warships. If the Inca build a fleet as well, Andahuaylas will send its vessels into battle.\n\n- Another important city of the Chanca is Abancay (Blue), which is located in the east. The city is less fortified than Waman Karpa, but has a well-trained army and a small fleet guarding the city's docks. Abancay will mainly be sending Örnkrigare, Pikenerare and Mangoneler.\n\n- Anccu Hualloc (Red/Orange) has built a fortress in the center of the map, in which he entrenched himself with his army. Anccu Hualloc's forces consist of Archers, Eagle and Jaguarkrigare, as well as several warships. If the Inca manage to kill Anccu Hualloc, this would damage the morale and discipline of the defenders of Waman Karpa.\n\n- The tribes of the Colla (Grey) were recently subjugated by the Inca and are obliged to participate in the war against the Chanca by sending troops. Once the Colla have sent reinforcements, you will be in charge to command their warriors.\n\n- The local priesthood (Yellow) regard the Inca with favor.

Once you convert each raja, his buildings will become yours. Rapidly taking over the Indian states may seem appealing given the benefits, but it will also extend your frontier and aggravate your neighbors.\n\n3. The first raja that you convert will share his unique wisdom with you. Bhima is an expert horse rider; Subhatavarman is a pious man who believes in infanteri tactics; Paramardi is a master of the bow; and Vijayasimha is specialized in siege tactics. Subsequent conversions still yield benefits but are no longer specific.\n\n4. Killing a raja instead of converting him will not bring defeat, but you will not receive his buildings.\n\n5.

The area around Dos Pilas is crawling with bandits. They will pick off any unwanted traveller they see.\n\n3. There are not many gold mines available. However there are different ways to accumulate gold. For example by defeating raider camps, sacking enemy cities, collecting relics or trading."
//66109	"Your scouts report:\n\n- The soldiers of Balaj Chan K'awiil (Cyan) are defending a ford against the forces of Calakmul but the Calakmul army outnumbers them.\n\n- Dos Pilas (Yellow) is a small city aligned with its founding city, Tikal. Dos Pilas will train Örnkrigare, Spjutbärare and Archers.\n\n- Tikal (Orange) is a huge city located to the east. They will train a host of different units like Örnkrigare, Monks, Skärmytslare and Scorpio. Their unique unit, the Slungkastare, will tear apart any infanteri which comes near it.\n\n- Calakmul (Purple) is another colossal city, located in the north of Dos Pilas. Just as Tikal, their military will be diverse, training Örnkrigare, Monks, Archers Swordmen and Mangoneler. Their unique unit, the Jaguarkrigare, will be a pain to fight against in hand to hand combat. Taking them out from a distance with our skyttar is the best option.\n\n- Uaxactun (Blue) is another small city siding with Tikal. They will be training a small army of swordsmen, Spjutbärare, rams and Archers to fight their opponents.\n\n- Naranjo (Red) is probably the smallest city in the area. Their military consists of Örnkrigare, Fjäderprydda Bågskyttar, mangonels and Archers. The ruler of Naranjo is not aggressive and prefers to focus on defences.\n\n- The Mayan Raiders (Green) are a pain for everyone. They roam the countryside around Dos Pilas and harass unsuspecting victims. It is believed they are being paid by either Tikal or Calakmul, or both."

Northumbria trains infantry, cavalry, and Monks, and also has a navy.\n\n- The vulnerable Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia (Orange) lies to the east. Its forces are composed of swordsmen, archery units, and ships.\n\n- The formidable Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia (Blue) dominates the center of the map. Mercia trains ranged units and cavalry.\n\n- Located to the southeast, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex is by far your most dangerous adversary.

//66308	"1. The Magyarer can support a population limit of 100 when nomadic and 150 when sedentary. There are other restrictions as well (unique to this scenario), since they are a nomadic people. For example, the Riddartiden Forska fram will only become available once the Avars are defeated, and the Imperietiden Forska fram will only become available once one of the other main factions—Great Moravia, East Francia, or the Bulgarer—is defeated.\n\n2. The Magyarer gain resources from looting enemy buildings, and sending captured animals to their pen. They also capture enemy Villagers when they destroy an enemy Centum.\n\n3. Think carefully about when you want to build your Centum. You will lose the benefits of the nomadic way of life, and the conversion to a sedentary lifestyle will be slow. However, it will be difficult to hold on to nomadism for the entire game.\n\n4. The enemy will not sit idle while you raid, so keep them on their toes and harass their economies to keep them weak.\n\n5. The Bulgarer are a tempting target for raids, so you could consider opening hostilities and attacking their lands. Just be careful to not take on too many enemies at once."
//66309	"Your scout reports:\n\n- The Magyarer (Cyan) have left their old homeland on the steppe in exchange for the rich pastures of the Carpathian Basin in Eastern Europe. They rely on livestock and raiding to fuel their expansion - if that ceases, the only way to survive will be to become like the Europeans and build Centrer, Houses, Slott, and Farms.\n\n- The Avars (Orange) reside next to the Magyarer. Once a powerful nomadic people themselves, they are now scattered and weak. It is advisable to raid and pillage their camps in order to grow stronger. Their army consists of Ryttarskyttar, Spanarkavalleri, and Tarkhaner.\n\n- To the north, Great Moravia (Yellow) dominated Bohemia and its surrounding lands for centuries, but they too have become weak because of internal conflicts and rivalries with their neighbors. They have a few Slott, but those can be easily evaded. The Moravians train swordsmen and Pikenerare, which are no match for the Magyar mobile kavalleri forces.\n\n- East Francia (Red) lies to the west and is one of the strongest powers in the region. Previously part of the great Carolingian Empire, they remain powerful even after its division and can field a powerful army behind the strong fortifications that defend their lands. They will train Armborstskyttar, Skärmytslare, Tung cavalry, Ordensriddare, and Mangoneler.\n\n- The Bulgarer (Green) to the south have no quarrel with the Magyarer and are on friendly terms. However, that does not mean that they should be left in peace. They have many fortified bases, but their villages are poorly defended. They will train swordsmen, Lätt Kavalleri, and Konniks.\n\n- There are rumors that the Bysantiner (Blue) have sent a delegation to these lands to seek allies in their war against the Bulgarer. Their proposal may be of interest to the Magyarer."

It is loosely unified, however, and will be demoralized beyond help should their leader fall in battle.\n\n- A pair of Visigoth fortresses (Cyan) in the northeast watch over much of the region, and their troops will aggressively resist any invader. The core of their armies is infantry, but they will employ small contingents of Lätt Kavalleri and siege engines as well, and send warships to attack by sea.\n\n- In the north lies the well-fortified city of Cordoba (Purple), which must be taken if the Berber army is to control southern Iberia. Legions of Riddare, Armborstskyttar, Pikenerare, and Monks will provide staunch resistance on the land, while their warships will defend the city from amphibious incursions.\n\n- There are a couple of local villages (Grey) spread across the region that may be willing to aid your war effort once Roderic's army is defeated.\n\n"

You have no way of researching upgrades, but local villages may be impressed by your army and supply you with the upgrades you need.\n\n4. Protect your ranged units - their tactical value increases exponentially in this land of cliff paths and narrow passes.\n\n5. Throughout most of the map, the high walls of the mountains will protect your troops from the worst of the elements. Cliffed passes, however, are treacherous and exposed to the harsh winds.

Their location makes them apt resting places but seemingly little more.\n\nThree enemies pose a significant threat to the Umayyad army as it crosses the Pyrenees:\n\n- The Asturians (Red) are only a faint presence in this region, but their fortified bastion in the center of the map and well trained, heavily rustninged troops nevertheless pose a threat worth considering.\n\n- The Visigoths (Purple) prowl the eastern Pyrenees and are based in a fortress overlooking one of the major eastern passes. Their balanced army of infantry, ranged units, and kavalleri will provide stout opposition to any who would pass their way.\n\n- The Basques (Green) are native to the western Pyrenees.

He is an overbearing taskmaster which makes his men easily swayed by promises of gold and divine intercession.

Quickly build up an economy and seek out new sources of income to finance your army.\n\n5. Gunpowder units are powerful. Beware those of the enemy, but use your own to your advantage."
//71409	"Your scouts report:\n\n- Timur Lenk's forces (Purple) have arrived in Anatolia, the heart of the Ottoman Empire, and must hurry to establish a camp.\n\n- Timur Lenk's main adversary, the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid (Cyan), has marched his forces to the center of the map and camped there. When Bayezid launches his attack, be prepared to face Janitsjarer, Husarer, and Kanoner.\n\n- Assisting Bayezid's army are several companies of auxiliary troops (Green), some of whose loyalties are dubious. The Spahis of the Anatolian Beyliks field Ryttarskyttar and Tung Kamelryttare, the Qara Tatarer control a force of Tarkhaner and Kamelryttarskyttar, the Wallachians bring Pikenerare and Skärmytslare, and the Balkan auxiliaries are comprised of Fäktmästare and Armborstskyttar.\n\n- The Ottoman Empire (Blue) controls several minor supply camps scattered around the map, but operates mainly out of a dangerous mountain fortress far to the south. Expect to face the finest troops that the Ottomans can offer - Husarer, Janitsjarer, Beridna Bågskyttar, swordsmen, and Kanoner.\n\n- The Riddare Hospitaller (Red) command the city of Smyrna to the west. This military order musters an army of korsriddare both mounted and afoot supported by Skärmytslare, Monks, and powerful Blidor.\n\n- Taherten, a local Turkoman emir, rules the citadel of Erzincan (Yellow) in the east of the map. His loyalties are unknown, but it is clear that he has large forces of kavalleri at his disposal."

Securing these baronies is crucial, as the Normans there can bolster Robert’s warbands. The Normans fight as Riddare and Serjeants with components of support troops.\n\n- The Norman Drengot family (Cyan) competes with the Hautevilles in Italy. Their raiders will emerge from the sea and from the Norman baronies to indiscriminately plunder the region. They fight primarily as Riddare and Lätt Kavalleri.\n\n- The Bysantiner (Purple) once ruled all of Southern Italy. The failed revolt of a Lombard prince named Melus–supported by the first Norman arrivals–led to the weakening of Byzantine authority. Nevertheless, under Melus' son, Argyrus, the Bysantiner have reasserted themselves in the east and south with their diverse army and Legionärer.\n\n- Prince Guaimar (Yellow) rules the Lombards, descendants of Germanic immigrants who populate the north. The Lombards fight as infanteri and skyttar. Prince Guaimar is determined to rid Italy of the Bysantiner, even if it means risking the arrival of more dangerous Normans.\n\n- Finally, Saracen Pirates (Green) threaten all of Italy from their base in Sicily, where they receive the protection of the local Arab emirs.

He is joined by an exiled Muslim emir named Ibn at-Timnah (Yellow) who promises to help him.\n\n- Three Saracen emirs rule Sicily. Ibn al-Hawwas (Green) is based in central Sicily at Cerami, Ibn al-Ward (Orange) in the southeast at Syracuse, and Ibn Mankut (Purple) in the west at Mazara del Vallo. Each faction fights with a mix of Saracen unit types.\n\n- Two princes of the Berber Zirid dynasty seek power and influence over Sicily. Ayyub Zirid (Red) controls the north of the island from Palermo while his younger brother, Ali Zirid (Cyan), controls the south from Agrigento. Both princes command mobile armies of Kamelryttarskyttar, Kamelryttare, and cavalry.\n\n- Although Sicily has been ruled by Muslim emirs for two centuries, the island retains a diverse religious community (Grey) of Catholic and Orthodox Christians along with the Muslims.

His preparations for the invasion of the Byzantine Empire have been thwarted by his stepmother, the Lombard warrior princess Sikelgaita (Grey). He will need to rely on his own personal valor to attract Norman riddare to his banner.\n\n- Three Byzantine armies oppose Bohemond under the commands of the Emperor Alexios Komnenos (Purple) and his generals Nikephoros Melissenos (Green) and Gregorios Pakourianos (Yellow). The Byzantine armies consist of Legionärer and Katafrakter. Alexios Komnenos’ own force includes English Varangians (Bärsärkar) who seek revenge against the Normans following their defeat at Hastings in 1066. The Byzantine armies replenish themselves (heal rapidly), making them difficult to fight.\n\n- Bohemond can reduce the healing rate of these armies by destroying their military buildings defended by Byzantine Garrisons (Red).\n\n- Local factions opposed to the Bysantiner can help Bohemond, including the Bulgarer and the Bogomils, a heretical sect. Many Byzantine soldiers are secret followers of Bogomilism and may be willing to spy for Bohemond.\n\n- The Byzantine marches in the north hold back the nomadic Pechenegs (Orange). Destroying these defenses will unleash these hordes of Tarkhaner, Steppe Lancers, and Kipchaks on the Bysantiner.\n\n- Finally, the Norman adventurer Roussel de Bailleul ventured east with an army a few years ago. This army may still be alive, beyond the hostile Seljuk Turkar (Cyan)."

They have found the city’s stockpiles depleted.\n\n- Unfortunately for the Crusaders, the Seljuk Turk warlord Kerbogha (Cyan) has arrived with a massive army to retake the city. He has divided his army into several wings surrounding the city’s walls and six gates. His armies will attack in repeating waves of mixed troops. Despite his strength, Kerbogha is hesitant to press his advantage, as too many casualties may break his diverse army pulled from competing warlords. He will instead withdraw and reorganize for subsequent attacks on a predictable schedule.\n\n- Because Kerbogha arrived before the Crusaders could defeat the garrison entirely, Antioch’s citadel in the east is still held by the Muslim garrison led by Ahmed ibn-Marwan (Green). This force consists of Mamelukr, Kamelryttare, and skyttar and is protected by a Castle. While this garrison is unlikely to leave its position, making it less of a threat, it blocks access to additional resources in the hills behind the city.\n\n- Finally, a relieving army led by the Byzantine Emperor Alexios Komnenos is rumored to be on its way – likely to claim the city for the Empire.

//75209 "Your scouts report:\n\n- The newly-crowned King Roger II (Blue) faces many threats as he builds his kingdom. While his predecessors relied on military skills to attract riddare, Roger’s tolerance and statecraft have lured learned men from across the world. He is advised by his English chancellor, Robert of Selby, and an Arab scholar named Muhammad al-Idrisi.\n\n- The Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III (Yellow) has invaded Italy from his base to the north. His army consists of Ordensriddare, Paladiner, infantry, and siege weapons.\n\n- The Drengots have taken advantage of Roger’s patience to rebel under the leadership of Ranulf Drengot (Cyan). The Norman lord controls the southeast of Italy with Serjeants, cavalry, siege weapons, and a Norman fleet.\n\n- The Italian Cities (Red) of Pisa and Genoa have established bases in Sardinia and western Italy. These naval forces are allied with the Holy Roman Emperor and threaten King Roger with their warships, infantry, and Archers. They care mostly about trade, however, and may be convinced to support the Sicilianer.\n\n- Emperor John II Komnenos (Purple) has succeeded his father, Alexios Komnenos, as Byzantine Emperor. Though he desires to avenge his father’s losses to the Normans, he can be persuaded with bribes to remain in his eastern realm.\n\n- The Berber Sultan al-Hassan (Orange) relies on piracy after the loss of Zirid influence over Sicily following Roger Bosso’s conquest. He shelters and protects Saracen Pirates (Green). Even these pirates have their price, however."

72508	"1. To earn a medal from this challenge, you must vigilantly manage your Villagers at all times so that they are not idle, and assure that your Centum never stops producing Villagers.\n\n2. If you are having trouble with this challenge, observe your ally - he has done this before.\n\n3. To lure a Boar, send one Villager to shoot it twice. If you only shoot it once, it may not follow you the entire way back. After you have shot it for the second time, task your Villager to return to the Centum. Once the Boar is close to the Centum, task your other Villagers to kill it.\n\n4. Killing an animal with a military unit or a building like a Centum or a Skyddstorn—anything that is not a Villager—will spoil the meat and you will not be able to harvest it.\n\n5.

//

72608	"1. For more information about how to properly gather from Sheep and on how to lure Boars, check out the 'Early Economy' challenge.\n\n2. Exploring is very important in any game. You should immediately look for the two Boars and eight Sheep in the vicinity of your Centum. After that, you need to find your Forage Bushes, your main Gold Mine, and the nearby herd of Hjort. Most standard random games have 2 groups of Stenbrott and 3 groups of Gold Mines in total, so you should look for those as well. After that, you can start to search for the enemy spelare.\n\n3. You should use your most damaged Villagers to build Farms. That way, they are close to the Centum and safe.\n\n4. You can see what tasks your Villagers are assigned to by cycling through the minimap mode.\n\n5. Age of Empires II: DE has introduced mixed queuing. This means that you can queue both technologies and units at the same time. Be sure to make use of this feature.\n\n6. Another feature that the Definitive Edition introduces is multitasking by using the Shift hotkey. For example, if you build a House while having a Villager selected and then Shift + right-click on a tree, the Villager will go chop that tree immediately after it has built the House. This is a good way to avoid idling your Villagers, but will also take some time to get used to. Other uses for this feature include managing your Villagers gathering from Sheep or hunting Hjort.\n\n7. In this challenge, you will be told to build a Market and a Smedja. These two buildings are the cheapest and therefore the fastest way to advance to the Riddartiden.\n\n8. Skipping the Vävstol Forska fram is risky, but will allow you to advance to the next ages more quickly and speed your pursuit of a gold medal."
72609	"Your scouts report:\n\nWe have not gathered any information yet. You must instruct us to explore the surrounding region."
72610	"Click on your Centum and queue multiple Villagers."

72613	"Send any idle or new Villager to collect food from Sheep. Do this until you have six Villagers collecting from Sheep."
72614	"The next Villager that you create must build a Skogshuggarläger. Do not forget to queue up more Villagers as well. When they are created, task them to collect wood."
72615	"Do not forget to keep training Villagers. Your Centum should not fall idle."
72616	"Make sure that your Scout keeps on exploring. You need to find all eight Sheep and both Boars."
72617	"If you are relatively new to luring Boars, you should Forska fram Vävstol at your Centum after your next Villager is trained. Experienced spelare can save Vävstol for later."
72618	"The next Villager that you create will have to build a House near one of the Boars."
72619	"Set the rally point of your Centum on your Forage Bushes, and have the next Villager that you create build a Mill next to them."
72620	"Lure the Boar to your Centum. You should know how to lure a Boar by now - if you do not, play the 'Early Economy' challenge."
72621	"If you do not have the food to create more Villagers, force your Boar hunters to drop off their food at your Centum and then immediately task them back to the Boar."
72622	"Lure the second Boar with the next Villager that you create."
72623	"Have the next three Villagers also forage for berries."
72624	"Bygg another House."
72625	"Send the next six Villagers that you create to collect wood."
72626	"Bygg a second Skogshuggarläger to spread out your Lumberjacks. This will make your Lumberjacks more productive and ensure that you have two places to collect wood from in case of an enemy attack."
72627	"You will need another House after the next Villager is trained."
72628	"Send the next three Villagers to build a Gruvläger and mine gold."
72629	"When your last Boar is depleted, send the idle Villagers to gather from Sheep."
72630	"When your Sheep are nearly exhausted, start building eight Farms."
72631	"You will have enough Villagers to advance to the next age once the next one is trained. Queue the Feodaltiden Forska fram at your Centum."
72632	"There is not much to do while you wait to reach the Feodaltiden. Keep scouting and keep an eye on your Villagers to make sure that they do not go idle. Once you reach the Feodaltiden, you will need 325 wood to build a Smedja and a Market."
72633	"Queue up two more Villagers while you wait for the Feodaltiden to be researched. Have them and any other idle Villagers collect wood once they are created."
72634	"Now, task one Villager to build a Smedja and task two Villagers to build a Market."
72635	"Hint: If you have more than 900 food stockpiled, Forska fram Dubbeleggad Yxa at your Skogshuggarläger. This is a very good early technology."

Use rally points to ensure that your newly-trained Villagers immediately begin working.\n\n5. Bygg a lot of new Farms. You will need the food for Villagers and for the Imperietiden research. You can also automatically reseed your farms by selecting a Mill and clicking on the button to the far right of the command tab (located in the lower left of the User Interface).\n\n6. To advance to the next age, you will need two Riddartiden buildings such as a Kloster, University, or a Belägringsverkstad. A Castle alone also satisfies the requirement.\n\n7.

Use your units according to their respective strengths:\n\n- Archers are ranged units that are strong against Men-at-Arms and Spjutbärare, but weak against Skärmytslare and kavalleri units. They are best used in hit-and-run attacks against slower units.\n\n- Men-at-Arms are generic melee units that are especially strong against buildings and certain types of infantry, but are weak against kavalleri and ranged units.\n\n- Spjutbärare deal considerable bonus damage to cavalry, but are weak against nearly every other unit.\n\n- Skärmytslare are strong against Archers and Spjutbärare, but perform poorly against other units, especially because they cannot fire on units that are too close to them.\n\n- Spanarkavalleri are strong against ranged units, but should avoid Spjutbärare or large groups of Archers."

To minimize the damage that they inflict, use Staggered Formation.\n\n3. Use control groups to manage your units. To create a control group, select a group of units and simultaneously press Ctrl and one of the number keys (1-9). Then, to select the control group, press the number key that you assigned to it. You can have up to 9 groups at the same time.\n\n4. Use the terrain to your advantage. If you fight from higher ground, your units will deal more damage to the enemy units."

Krigsgalärs can attack from a long range, but are powerless against the flames of Brandskepp in close combat. Use them in large groups to outnumber the enemy fleet, and, if possible, pair them with Brandskepp.\n\n3. Due to their area-of-effect attack, Explosionsskepp will destroy or heavily damage most ships or groups of ships in a single devastating explosion. They are useful against any warship, but only if they can manage to reach it. They can also be devastating against Transportfartyg and land units.\n\n4. It is not easy to maneuver a Explosionsskepp close to an enemy ship. Distract your opponent with other ships before sending your Explosionsskepp to attack.\n\n5. Do not hesitate to use your Explosionsskepp--if destroyed, they will only count as losses if they do not reach their targets."
73209	"Your scouts report:\n\n- You command a respectable Riddartiden fleet in the northwest near an allied village (Yellow).\n\n- Your goal is to reach the eastern end of the river.

Murbräckor are the most effective siege weapons available in the Riddartiden for tearing down enemy buildings and fortifications. Mangoneler are effective against ranged units, siege weapons, and most buildings, but are extremely weak against fortifications that outräckvidd them, such as Slott and Vakttorns. Do not waste resources and time constructing other siege engines.\n\n3. If you have a Castle, you can train Petarder in it. These units can blow up enemy buildings, but it is important to array them in staggered formation to make Castle fire less damaging to the group. They are less effective than Murbräckor, however, and should not be used as a replacement for the latter."

You already have the buildings that you need to prepare the upcoming siege.\n\n- The enemy (Red) has built a settlement to the west, which is guarded by a Castle. To defeat the enemy, you will need to destroy the Castle. Your opponent will not go on the offensive, but will defend himself if you invade his realm."

73311	"Your opponent has a Castle in the west. To defeat him, you must destroy this stronghold, but you will need siege weapons."
73312	"You can train four different types of siege weapons at the Belägringsverkstad."
73313	"Mangoneler and Scorpio are effective against enemy units but lack the durability and räckvidd required to destroy Slott."

The Taira do not yet know that supplies have been delivered to the city, but they will soon attack ferociously.\n\n4. The sea is of great strategic importance, but the route out of the bay is blocked by dangerous rocks...\n\n5.

They train Lätt Kavalleri, Spjutbärare, and Armborstskyttar, but may also field Samuraj.\n\n- The Taira Guards (Green) patrol the countryside with cohorts of infantry, and their Villagers are feeding and supplying the Taira forces.\n\n- Surrounded by a moat and heavily fortified, the Taira capital of Kyoto (Cyan) has yet to be captured by an invading army. Should the walls be breached, legions of Samuraj, Hillebardjärer, and Ryttarskyttar will rush to the defense.\n\n- The Taira armies are commanded by fierce warlords and princes (Red), not the least of them the statesman Taira no Koremori. Killing the princes commanding the Taira armies in the field is vital to the success of your armies."

The other Turkish factions might be interested in forming an alliance with Osman. Choose wisely, since they are fierce rivals of each other and you will only be able to choose one.\n\n3. The Turkar have a wide array of units available. Will you preserve your nomadic traditions and rely on a mobile kavalleri force, or will you upset the tribes and field a more innovative army of Janitsjarer and other gunpowder units instead?\n\n4. Osman (Red) and his followers (Purple) have different strengths initially: while Osman can already field Kavaljerer, his followers can already train Tung Ryttarskyttar."
//110203 "Your scouts report:\n\n- Osman (Red) and his followers (Purple) initially reside in the Rum Sultanate (Grey) to the east. The Sultanate has been overrun by the Mongoler, and so Osman must go west to claim the lands of his family.\n\n- The Byzantine Empire (Blue) has several fortified cities to the northwest, which are vulnerable now that the Empire is weak. The Bysantiner defend their cities with a force of Katafrakter, Pikenerare, and Skärmytslare. Rumor has it that the Bysantiner have hired Europeans from Iberia to fight for them.\n\n- There are three minor Turkish factions in the region: Karesi to the west, Germiyan to the south, and Candar to the east.\n\n- Karesi (Green) is the only Turkish faction with access to the water, and will construct warships to contest the Byzantine supremacy at sea. Their land force consists of Skärmytslare, Ryttarskyttar, Husarer, and siege units. Later, they will replace their Skärmytslare with Hakeskyttar.\n\n- Germiyan (Yellow) has a strong nomadic tradition and it is said that their horse skyttar never miss their mark. They will field an army of Lätt Kavalleri, Kamelryttare, and Beridna Bågskyttar that they will use to launch regular raids on their enemies.\n\n- Candar (Cyan) has adopted the use of Tung kavalleri and fortifications almost on par with those of the Europeans. Relying on their defenses, they will take their time before engaging their enemies in the field. They will train an army of swordsmen and Tung cavalry."

A Mongol army of Lätt Kavalleri, Ryttarskyttar, Mangudai and siege units has now arrived to retaliate.\n\n- To the east is Singhasari (Blue), a formerly strong kingdom now dominated by Kediri. They are aggressive and will attack with Armborstskyttar, Beridna Bågskyttar, Battle Elephants, Long Fäktare and Mangoneler.\n\n- To the west lies a fortified Castle from which Kediri (Cyan) retains control of the surrounding villages.

His royal guards are staunch defenders, but eventually they will succumb to the rebels attacks.\n\n- The city of Trowulan (Orange) has been occupied by rebels. The rebels have assigned their strongest men to hold the walls against attacks from outside the city. These defenders include Pilbösseskyttar, Fäktmästare, Battle Elephants, Onagerer, and Hillebardjärer. The rebel army under the command of Rakrian Kuti (Blue) himself will be attacking the king.

The kingdom wields a strong force of Fäktare, Armborstskyttar, Ballista Elephants, Galeons, and Brandskepp. Dharmasraya is the most likely to regularly attack us.\n\n- To the north lies Malajersia, part of the Asian continent. Here the Tumasik (Blue) have broken free from their former overlords and have built the mighty city of Singapore. They compete with us over the control of the sparsely inhabited islands which we are trying to colonize. They focus on destroying our colonies before attacking our home island.

Doing this saves wood from building farms and that wood can instead be used for building a navy. When fishing spots become depleted you can make use of the Malajer's unique fish trap bonus to get an endless supply of food that way.\n\n3. Your enemies have a strong naval presence. Bygging fortifications on the islands can help defend your bases and let you concentrate your ships in fewer locations.\n\n4. Some enemies have Fortified Torn. The best way to deal with these large torn is with several Kanongaleoner. Using other ships to distract the fire coming from the torn is also a good way to prevent your Kanongaleoner from taking fire."

Majapahit sailors (Red) have been ordered to look for a nearby village from where a new fleet can be build.\n\n- To the east the Kutai (Blue) control many of the smaller islands. They are mainly pirates and rely on small but fast ships. They will also use rafts filled with gunpowder to take down larger vessels.\n\n- The Makassar (Green) live on the other side of the eastern archipelago and southwest of our location. They are well-fortified and better equipped then the Kutai. They mainly rely on Krigsgalärer and Brandskepp to deal with enemy vessels but also have skyttar defending their shores. We definitely can expect them to try to raid us.\n\n- Farther to the south are the Luwu (Yellow).

Its defenders rely on its strong fortifications and have stored gunpowder in the city, allowing them access to advanced units such as Kanoner and Hakeskyttar.\n\n- General Wang Tong (Purple) has a camp to the northeast.

	// 01 - William Wallace

	//201101 "We are without a leader. The dead king of Scotland has no heir."
	//201102 "War creeps in from the south, where Edward Longshanks, the avaricious King of England, has returned from successful campaigns in Wales and France. As Longshanks turns his attention to Scotland, the shadow of fear settles across the Highlands."
	//201103 "The English have thousands of Welsh longbowmen, hundreds of riddare on horseback, and dozens of siege weapons."
	//201104 "We Scottish have a rabble of untrained soldiers who do not even know how to march in a straight line. We must act soon. If we are to have any chance of resistance, we need to forge an army by any means necessary."
	//201151 "Scotland has soldiers now, if only a few. But if we are to turn back the greed of Edward Longshanks, we will need many more recruits, and much more gold in our coffers."
	//201152 "These ancient stones and oaks around us will soon be drenched with the blood of clansmen."
	//
	//201201 "An army marches on its stomach, or so the old saying goes. My clansmen have been farming and tending sheep for hundreds of years...but gathering enough food to feed an army is a different matter entirely."
	//201202 "Without a strong economy, the meager forces that we have cobbled together will collapse again."
	//201251 "Edward Longshanks, for all his disrepute, has shown his military tactics in Wales, England, and France to be very effective, if not cruel and ruthless. He is indeed an enemy to be feared. The English sacked the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed. With that I could call it a battle, but it was truly more of a massacre."
	//201252 "Unless we organize our army, there will be more massacres to follow. I pray that we can be ready when Longshanks comes."
	//
	//201301 "In villages throughout the Highlands, there is grim talk of skirmishes between Scotland and England. We lost the town of Dunbar this week. Scottish defenders broke ranks and fled. The English have an army that is larger and better trained."
	//201302 "To compete with them, we are going to need new recruits to pick up spear, sword, and bow. We must transform these shepherds into soldiers."
	//201351 "Now that we have militias stationed across the border, the English have slowed their raids. But facing Longshanks' army will be another matter. The wicked English king has yet to bring his famous longbows to bear."
	//201352 "Our militias can only get us so far. We are going to need more advanced weapons."
	//
	//201401 "Rumors creep in from the south of a giant who leads the forces of Scotland, his great sword driving through earth, man, and horse alike. If this mythical riddare can stall the English advance, it will give us time to develop the arms we need."
	//201402 "Even now our smiths are Smide swords, and fletchers are crafting arrows and crossbow bolts."
	//201451 "Longshanks has invaded, stormed, and sacked the city of Perth. Worse, he has captured the fabled Stone of Scone and declared himself King of Scotland."
	//201452 "If we cannot bring about a victory in battle soon, the Scottish armies will be too demoralized to put up any fight at all. If this mythical Scottish giant does exist, I wish that he would bring his forces up to Stirling, where we shall next do battle."
	//
	//201501 "The time for minor skirmishes is over. We now prepare for war."
	//201502 "The villain, Longshanks, is poised to cross the River Forth and threaten the town of Stirling with a force of men-at-arms, Tung cavalry, and a multitude of skyttar."
	//201503 "Our newly forged army marches southward to establish our own base and attack the English before they can ready their troops."
	//201551 "Stirling was our first great victory. Even as we held the coastline, word arrived that Stirling Bridge had been held by a force of Scots led by the mythical riddare of whom so many have spoken."
	//201552 "Now we know his name: Sir William Wallace, the bane of the English."
	//201553 "Edward Longshanks names Wallace a traitor and a criminal. Sir William replies that he cannot be a traitor, for he never swore fealty to an English king."
	//201554 "With Wallace leading our armies, the men fight with renewed vigor. Perhaps the tide of our misfortunes is about to turn..."
	//
	//201601 "Our coffers were depleted at the Battle of Stirling, so we need to strengthen our economy once again before pushing south into lands held by the English."
	//201602 "We need to construct a market and establish trade routes to the villages of friendly clans."
	//201603 "Local legends speak of three sacred relics hidden south of Stirling. Acquiring these artifacts for Wallace's army will be a great boost to Scottish morale."
	//201651 "With the three relics locked away safely in Scottish churches, men murmur that we are blessed by the heavens."
	//201652 "Our army now stands a chance as we prepare for the final clash with the English.  Scotland now has skyttar and riddare of our own with which to meet Longshanks."
	//201653 "We march south, to Falkirk, where we will join with the army of William Wallace and plan our combined attack upon the English castle."
	//
	//201701 "The only way that we can hold the boggy lowlands around Falkirk is to build a castle and as many walls as we can construct in a short time."
	//201702 "These fortifications will serve to protect our camp as we construct siege weapons with which to assault the English castle."
	//201703 "Once the castle is constructed, Wallace himself has sworn to join our forces. Together we will attack Longshanks and his English troops."
	//201751 "It looked certain that we would be defeated at Falkirk. Yet somehow, though outnumbered and outranged by English longbows, we were victorious."
	//201752 "The English castle was torn down, and a Scottish one shall be built in its place."
	//201753 "William Wallace has shown us the path to victory. Although he is but one man, he inspires great deeds in others. Many of the Scottish riddare and lords have drawn their swords with his."
	//201754 "Wallace's own sword is a five-and-a-half-foot beast, forged of course in Scotland."
	//201755 "He has sworn not to rest until his sword finds the neck of Edward Longshanks. The struggle will continue, but we have learned the ways of war. Now it is the English who will know true fear."
	//
	//
	//// 02 - Joan of Arc
	//
	//202101 "February 19, Army Camp near Vaucouleurs."
	//202102 "This morning I awoke to visions of fire and steel. These nightmares come more often now that I have seen my beloved France eaten away by years of war."
	//202103 "I wandered through camp ignoring the new snowfall, but observing the wounds and weariness of every soldier under my command. Observing the desperation in their eyes."
	//202104 "It was then that I first saw the girl. She told us that her name was Joan. She told us she was but a peasant, who did not know how to ride or fight. She told us that she intended to rescue France. The darkness lifted from the men's souls."
	//202105 "Her voice rang with conviction, and we drank in her every word. I may have lost my Tro, but Joan has not lost hers, and that is enough for me."
	//202106 "Joan has asked our ragged band of soldiers to take her to Chinon, where the rightful ruler of France, the dauphin, hides from his foes."
	//202107 "The war-torn land in between is infested with enemy marauders, and we will lose many men.  Death is by now an old companion, but for Joan, we will face it again."
	//202151 "As Joan's footsteps echoed down the marbled hall of the château, the fat and whispering dukes did naught but stare."
	//202152 "The dauphin himself seemed afraid as she kissed his feet. 'My gentle dauphin,' she demanded, 'why does England claim what is ours? Why are you not crowned King of France as is your right?'"
	//202153 "The courtiers began to murmur. The chamberlain whispered lies into the dauphin's ear."
	//202154 "But the dauphin pushed the chamberlain away and rose to meet Joan's gaze."
	//202155 "She stands only to the shoulder of the shortest man, but all of us must look up to speak to her."
	//202156 "I know not what silent conversation passed between the dauphin and his would-be savior, but it was obvious that his Majesty was in the same thrall as we."
	//
	//202201 "March 26, Chinon."
	//202202 "It is one thing for a band of dispirited soldiers to put their trust in a teenage girl. It is entirely another for that girl to be given command of the army of an entire nation."
	//202203 "We were filled with pride when we heard the dauphin's heralds pronounce Jungfrun Jeanne as commander of the army of France."
	//202204 "So that she may look like a general, the dauphin presented Joan with a great warhorse and a suit of white rustning."
	//202205 "Joan instructed me to look for an ancient sword buried beneath the altar of a local church."
	//202206 "I was skeptical, but not only did the men unearth a rusted blade, but we found that the sword had belonged to Karl den store, grandfather of France. I shall not doubt her word again. Still visible on the hilt was the fleur-de-lis."
	//202207 "Joan adopted the fleur-de-lis as her symbol and had it blazoned upon her battle standard. Wherever Joan goes, the standard goes also. It goes with us to Orléans."
	//202208 "The city of Orléans is one of the finest in France, but it is under siege by our enemies, England and Burgundy, and is about to fall."
	//202209 "This war has dragged on for one hundred years with precious few French victories. The people of Orléans need a savior. They will receive Joan of Arc."
	//202251 "Joan prophesied that she would be wounded at Orléans. At the height of the battle, an arbalest bolt knocked her from her horse. We could not believe our misfortune."
	//202252 "But as we carried Joan away from the carnage, the battle was won. Orléans was free."
	//202253 "When we entered the city, the entire population cheered us on from windows, rooftops, and city streets."
	//202254 "They fired artillery into the night sky and shouted aloud their nickname for Joan: 'La Pucelle'-The Maid of Orléans."
	//
	//202301 "June 14, Orléans."
	//202302 "Our rescue of Orléans was a setback for our enemies, but only a minor one. The English still possess half of France."
	//202303 "Tragically, we have cooled our heels for weeks while the dauphin's advisors debate."
	//202304 "Joan became irritated with the delay and reassembled her army. She talks of nothing but her mission to drive the English into the sea."
	//202305 "The force of Joan's will is titanic. She has gathered to her banner swearing brigands and knaves and turned them into patriots and heroes."
	//202306 "Among them is the man La Hire. A giant clad in plate mail; he drives men on with curses and fists. There will be plenty of English necks for La Hire to break at Patay."
	//202307 "Patay is the gateway to the Loire River Valley.  The English hold the Loire in a grip of steel, whilst a huge army under Sir John Fastolf devastates the countryside."
	//202308 "Joan leads us to Patay to capture the English castles. However, we must avoid Fastolf's army until we are strong enough to face his veterans."
	//202351 "After Patay, the myth of English invulnerability was dispelled. Now our army knows it is possible to win, but only if we are resolute and cunning."
	//202352 "The English are a most deadly enemy, and their longbowmen have decimated a charge of French riddare time and time again."
	//202353 "To make matters worse, we now face enemies on both sides. The dauphin's advisors spend more and more time wrangling, jealous of Joan's influence at court."
	//202354 "I pray that Joan can complete her divine mission before the dauphin's envious advisors betray her."
	//
	//202401 "June 25, Orleans."
	//202402 "Dead France is returning to life. Our army swells with new recruits. In olden times, men swore fealty only to their particular lord."
	//202403 "Now we fight not for insolent lords and ladies, but for France. For all of us, Joan is France. There is no distinction in our minds."
	//202404 "The dauphin himself has arrived in Orléans. Never have I seen such a celebration. France needs a king, so we must escort the dauphin to Rheims where he can be properly crowned."
	//202405 "Yet, the city of Rheims is dangerously menaced by the Anglo-Burgundian army. The cities of Troyes and Chalons also bar the way."
	//202406 "Joan commands that we must liberate all three cities before the coronation, and we eagerly seek to fight."
	//202451 "As we rode into Rheims, a sea of peasants and lords knelt before Joan. Some even knelt to kiss her horse's hoofprints. Cannon thundered and a thousand flags danced in the breeze."
	//202452 "In the enormous palace, the dauphin knelt before the archbishop and rose as King of France. Prayers, anthems, and sermons filled the great château."
	//202453 "Interspersed among perfumed dukes and ladies were tattered soldiers from our army, many still bearing wounds."
	//202454 "Joan herself was at the king's side, as was her bedraggled battle standard."
	//202455 "Despite the celebration, I know in my heart that this war is far from over. Our fathers and grandfathers died fighting the English."
	//202456 "Joan gives us hope, but I do not know if hope is enough to ensure victory."
	//
	//202501 "September 3, Rheims."
	//202502 "France has a king once more. However, as Joan gains influence with the people, jealousy grows within the court."
	//202503 "The king's evil advisors now seek to destroy Joan. It is only a matter of time before they succeed in poisoning the king's mind."
	//202504 "Joan must hurry to fulfill her mission. Paris, the jewel of France, has been under English tyranny for decades, and French patriots trapped within the city are eager to escape. We are now marching on Paris, hoping that the reinforcements we have been promised will arrive in time."
	//202551 "Tragedy. As the refugees fled into the château of Compiègne, Joan was trapped outside. Burgundian soldiers knocked her from her horse and paraded around with their prisoner."
	//202552 "None of us can sleep, knowing our precious Joan of Arc languishes in a Burgundian prison."
	//202553 "The soldiers stare at the uncaring sky, condemning themselves for being unable to save her...for being unable to save France."
	//202554 "Paris was the first major defeat ever dealt to our army. Had the king sent the promised reinforcements, we would have captured the city. Now, it is France's darkest hour."
	//
	//202601 "July 14, Bordeaux."
	//202602 "No Joan of Arc. A rich world made empty and poor! The English put her on trial as a heretic. Joan's mind was as sharp as her sword, and she avoided all the cunning verbal traps of her prosecutors."
	//202603 "In the end, Joan would not renounce her mission. The English found her guilty..."
	//202604 "...and burned her at the stake."
	//202605 "But her death is not in vain. 'La Pucelle' is the rallying cry as peasant and nobleman alike take arms. My army is an army of the people, and even without the king we are poised to strike at the English stronghold of Castillon."
	//202606 "A victory at Castillon will crush the English pretensions in France forever."
	//202607 "Should I die in this battle, I die for the Maid of Orléans. I die as a patriot of France."
	//202651 "A century of English toil, blood, and victories was reversed in a little over a year by a teenage girl. The Hundred Years' War has ended."
	//202652 "Even more importantly, Joan's acts ignited a sense of French nationalism. Peasants and nobles alike no longer belong to lords and kings, but to France herself."
	//202653 "We will not let Joan be forgotten.  Already, statues and stained glass portraits have been commissioned in hundreds of towns and cities throughout France."
	//202654 "Her verdict of guilt was rightfully reversed, and I expect that Joan of Arc will soon be beatified as a saint."
	//202655 "Sometimes the outcome of history is determined by strength of arms, other times by happenstance."
	//202656 "But in fifteenth century France, history was determined by the will of a young girl..."
	//202657 "...the only person in history to command the armies of an entire nation at the age of seventeen."

	//// 03 - Saladin
	//
	//203101 "Egypt. A month since I entered the Holy Land..."
	//203102 "I was in a foreign land. And I was dying."
	//203103 "I wandered the cold desert for four nights before the horse skyttar found me. I had abandoned my mount to the vultures and my skydd to the heat of day. For a riddare, I was not much of a threat to them."
	//203104 "I thought these men were Turkar, come to toy with their prey. But when I could distinguish the riders from the blur of the mirage I saw that they were Saracens, the rulers of the Middle East. I had ridden to the Holy Land with the Crusaders from France and Normandy, so I was by all rights the Saracens' enemy."
	//203105 "Yet they gave me water and a spindly horse and led me back to their leader."
	//203106 "And that was how I met Saladin. The paintings in Europe show Saladin as a demonic barbarian. Yet he is more chivalrous than any riddare I'd met before, and prefers the palaces of Damascus to slaughtering Normans in the desert. I had not expected hospitality from Saracens...we Normans execute any armed Arab we capture."
	//203107 "But Saladin left me free to explore his camp. Perhaps he wants an objective observer to chronicle the prodigious bloodshed ahead."
	//203108 "Saladin's army is heading south to Egypt to reinforce Cairo. Egypt is a tempting prize for the Crusaders. She is fabulously wealthy, yet governed by an ineffectual fool. Before my capture, I was en route to join in the Crusaders' assault on Egypt."
	//203109 "It is a bitter irony that now I shall view the contest from the enemy camp. So it was that I found myself less than a hundred miles from the Dead Sea, in the company of my enemies."
	//203151 "The Franker are dispersed, and the Egyptian army broken. Saladin has taken his place as governor of the Nile. Any European king would seize this opportunity to eliminate his political enemies. Saladin however, allowed any Egyptian opposed to his rule to leave the city unharmed."
	//203152 "Saladin has set out to win over the population. In Cairo, he built mosques and palaces, universities and hospitals. My own countrymen, the sons of Europe, showed naught but treachery, while the Saracener work to dignify their civilization. It is a troubling turn of events and I have difficulty sleeping."
	//
	//203201 "The Holy City of Medina. Year fifteen of my capture..."
	//203202 "Volumes have I filled with my fatigued writings. Lord Saladin reads them only rarely. He speaks of greater events yet to come."
	//203203 "The political boundaries in this endless desert have shifted as a result of three Crusades. Four Crusader states now exist in the Holy Land."
	//203204 "After the Saracen victory in Egypt, the Crusader leaders realized that Saladin was worthy of their concern. They were quick to suggest a treaty."
	//203205 "I hoped that with peace at last upon us, I would be returned to my own folk, but this peace, so short-lived, is already broken."
	//203206 "And it is not Saracen, but Crusader that has violated his word of honor. Reynald de Chatillon, a wicked French riddare, has been raiding Arab territory in defiance of the treaty."
	//203207 "He attacks trade caravans, and his pirate ships threaten the Saracen holy cities of Medina and Mecca. Saladin, in his fury, has sworn to kill Reynald with his own hands."
	//203251 "Although I am still prisoner, Saladin and his generals dine with me. Over meals we discuss mathematics and astronomy. I never imagined a race of desert folk could be so wise."
	//203252 "Baghdad, the Saracen capital, is the most civilized city in the world, with free hospitals, public baths, a postal service, and banks with branches as far away as China."
	//203253 "But as we eat, talk inevitably turns to war. Reynald's pirate vessels now rot at the bottom of the Red Sea. His raids have stopped. Reynald has escaped, but I suspect Saladin shall neither forgive nor forget."
	//
	//203301 "Galilee. Year twenty of my capture..."
	//203302 "Last night we rode into a sandstorm. The men dared not open their mouths to speak. We clung to the necks of horses or camels while waves of sand rose and fell around us."
	//203303 "The Saracener have pursued a large force of Europeans into the desert. The Crusaders carry with them a relic - a piece of Det Sanna Korset. Capturing this artifact will deal a severe blow to the morale of Saladin's Christian foes."
	//203304 "I asked Saladin why we were here, miles from civilization and water. He said 'to bring crimson death to the blue-eyed enemy.'"
	//203305 "The huge Crusader army has halted to make its stand beneath the two peaks called the Horns of Hattin. At the Horns is only a single pool of water, and Saladin controls it."
	//203306 "At night, the Saracener ride out and extravagantly pour out vessels of water into the sand within sight of the thirst-crazed Europeans. It is cruelty worthy of a...Crusader."
	//203351 "The fighting was fierce - the Crusaders had to conquer or die. Mostly, they died."
	//203352 "Saladin has treated his prisoners well, providing them with ice water from the mountains and comfortable tents. For the first time in years, I have been able to speak to fellow countrymen. But I am unsure what to say to these...invaders."
	//203353 "Not all of the prisoners were treated so royally. Reynald de Chatillon was captured here and, fulfilling his vow, Saladin sliced off Reynald's head with his own scimitar. How ironic that it was only after the Crusaders entered their lands that the Saracener were transformed into the people that we set out to destroy."
	//
	//203401 "Jerusalem. Twenty years have I been with the Saracens..."
	//203402 "Saladin's target is Jerusalem. The great, ancient city is sacred to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and is the virtual capital of the Holy Land. If there can be a victor in this endless conflict, it will be the army that holds Jerusalem."
	//203403 "To complicate matters, Saladin is determined not to harm the city itself. If a single holy shrine is damaged, the populace might well view Saladin not as a liberator, but as yet another conqueror."
	//203451 "The last time I entered Jerusalem, as a korsriddare, I waded through the blood of victims. This time, not a building was looted, not a townsperson was injured. Saladin set free nearly every prisoner he took."
	//203452 "The citizens of Jerusalem proclaimed Saladin as their savior. He offered to free me, but after twenty years in his service I have decided to see this journey to the end."
	//
	//203501 "Tiberias.  Twenty and a half years of bloodshed..."
	//203502 "We are far from the ocean, so the Saracener interpret the smell of salt and commotion of seabirds as signs from Heaven."
	//203503 "I sit near Saladin's tent, watching the butchery below. Saracen horse skyttar sweep through yet another disorganized mob of European soldiers."
	//203504 "The great Crusader nations have been reduced to puny city-states. Only Tiberias, Tyre, and Ascalon are still in Crusader hands. Nonetheless, these three cities are well fortified and could withstand any siege."
	//203505 "Saladin has had many victories on the open desert, but the Crusader castles are unparalleled. If he is victorious now, the Holy Land will belong to the Saracener again. A failure could mean even more decades of carnage."
	//203551 "Once, I was amazed at the nobility of the Saracen warriors. Only a few years ago they entered battle as gentlemen, bringing with them treasure chests, wine, singing girls, and collections of doves, nightingales, and parrots. No longer."
	//203552 "In reaction to European hostility and fanaticism, the Saracener have steadily become more resolute...more bloodthirsty. Their love of art is replaced by a love for battle. Now, in answer to the crusade, they have adapted their principle of jihad for warfare."
	//203553 "The result has been devastating to the Crusaders. The European presence in the Holy Land was finished. Or so everyone believed."
	//
	//203601 "The city of Acre. Nearly twenty-one years have I ridden with Saladin..."
	//203602 "When word of the Saracen victory at Jerusalem reached Europe, another crusade was launched. The kings of the three most powerful nations in Europe - England, France, and the Holy Roman Empire - embarked for the Holy Land with thousands of troops."
	//203603 "Saladin knows that his most dangerous opponent is Rikard Lejonhjärta of England, a brilliant tactician who learned the art of war fighting against his own father."
	//203604 "He builds colossal fortresses and always fights in the front lines - the ideal of a heroic warrior."
	//203605 "Richard's army has come ashore near Acre. Much of Saladin's army is trapped in the city, while two monstrous English trebuchets pound at Acre's walls. If Richard can defeat our army here, then he can walk into Jerusalem unopposed."
	//203606 "Saladin knows that this is the climax of his jihad. All of the Crusader states have fallen. If the Saracener can hold Acre, then the Europeans will be forced to return home."
	//203607 "If Acre falls, then the centuries-long nightmare of eternal war, raid and counter-raid, begin again. All of Saladin's victories will be for nothing."
	//203651 "The first year of my freedom..."
	//203652 "The fighting is over. The fire has gone out of Richard's lust for conquest. The two respected adversaries have begun to speak, finally, of peace."
	//203653 "War is not gentle with men's health. Richard fell ill with a fever. Because he respected his enemy, Saladin sent Richard fruit and mountain snow to comfort him. Soon enough, Richard boarded a ship headed back to England. The Third Crusade is over."
	//203654 "The final treaty was signed on September 2, 1192. By its terms, Jerusalem remains in Saracen hands, but Christian pilgrims are to be allowed to visit all the holy places, freely and safely. It seems a fitting compromise to a war that has been fought over religion and land."
	//203655 "The war is over, but I do not think I shall ever set foot in Normandy again. I want to see the steel foundries in Damascus and the gardens of the Caliph in Baghdad. I have never seen the mighty Krak de Chevaliers, now-fallen fortress of the Riddare Hospitaller. The Holy Land has many wondrous sights, and I can spend a lifetime here."
	//203656 "It is peace in the Holy Land...for the moment. Sadly, in a land so small, home to so many different cultures, birthplace of three of the world's great religions, I suspect that blood may one day stain the sand again."

	//// 04 - Djingis Khan
	//
	//204101 "A blue wolf took as his spouse a fallow doe. They settled at the head of the Onon River to raise their offspring. And there were born the Mongoler."
	//204102 "So begins my life's work, 'The Secret History of the Mongoler.' I have been selected to compose this epic, because great events are about to take place. We are going to leave Mongolia."
	//204103 "I have lived always on this frigid, dry, and endless steppe. The tribes here squabble like vultures fighting over the desiccated corpse of a marmot. We fight over limited resources: scarce water, few trees, sparse grass for our herds to graze on."
	//204104 "A wise and dangerous man named Temujin means to change all this. He says that if the tribal conflict is to end, the Mongoler require but two things. First, we need green pastures for our herds. With more to go around, there will be less competition among tribes."
	//204105 "Second, we are a culture of warriors; we need a common enemy with which to do battle."
	//204106 "To meet both these needs, Temujin has come up with the most modest of schemes: to unite the tribes and go to war with anyone who stands in our path."
	//204107 "'How?' we ask him. 'How can nomadic horsemen in felt tents embark on a campaign of world conquest?'"
	//204108 "Temujin replies that we will fight not as warriors, but as a unified army. We fight not for personal glory, but for the glory of the horde."
	//204109 "And with those words, the name of Temujin has passed almost into obscurity. His name is replaced with a title: Great Khan. Djingis Khan."
	//204151 "Nearly all of the Mongol tribes have united under the Great Khan. The chieftains of those tribes reluctant to join were boiled alive."
	//204152 "Each day new faces have taken up the bow; unfamiliar hands hold the nine bands of yak hair that has become Genghis' standard. There are more men and horses gathered in the camp than I ever knew existed."
	//204153 "Horse skyttar and lancers, men in leather cuirass and silk rustning, all lift their heads upward to the platform from where Genghis speaks. The Great Khan calls himself the punishment of God. Men smile like hungry wolves. It is dawn of the first day of the Mongol Empire."
	//
	//204201 "Winter has come to the steppes. The earth is frozen hard as bone, and the only movement is the steam rising from the nostrils of men and horses. Only the promise of battle brings warmth."
	//204202 "Nearly all of the tribes in Mongolia now answer to Djingis Khan. But with success, comes enemies. A man named Kushluk has challenged Genghis' right to rule. Kushluk sows discord among the Kara-Khitai Khanate and means to have himself proclaimed as a rival khan."
	//204203 "Genghis cannot allow these transgressions to go unpunished. He needs to set an example. So we ride west, to find and slay Kushluk. If the Kara-Khitai shelter him, then their lives are forfeit as well."
	//204251 "Djingis Khan knows that there are weapons aside from the lance and bow. He is a master of mental warfare. Just as he has made an example of Kushluk, he makes examples of enemy lands."
	//204252 "When first we encounter a new adversary, the Great Khan spares no one. We ride to the closest town, slay every living thing, burn down the city, sow the fields with salt, and make a mountain of enemy skulls."
	//204253 "After that, the other towns are quick to send forth their emissaries, eager to placate the ravenous Mongol hordes."
	//
	//204301 "Now all of Mongolia is in the grasp of Djingis Khan. Beyond are two vast empires: China to the east and Persia to the west. Persia is the sensible next choice of battle since it separates us from the rich forage pastures in Europe."
	//204302 "But first, Djingis Khan has another score to settle."
	//204303 "After witnessing the power of our kavalleri in action, the Kineser spoke of nothing but peace. They even promised support for our campaign westward."
	//204304 "But now that we have turned away from China, they have decided not to deliver the men and arms they promised Genghis."
	//204305 "It is time for another demonstration. Persia can wait as the horde wheels east once more, and we prepare to march into China, the largest, most advanced empire in the world."
	//204351 "It was...a glorious slaughter. For years, visitors to China will be astounded by the mountain of human and horse skeletons that we have erected."
	//204352 "Genghis' horde has gained one huge advantage by this invasion of China: technology. We now possess the knowledge and equipment to allow us to make siege weapons."
	//204353 "We will crack open the Persian and European castles to reach the softer parts within."
	//204354 "Genghis is pleased with our progress and with the legacy he leaves behind. His mother once ate wild onions and rodents to keep from starving. But the children and grandchildren of Genghis will eat off plates of Persian gold."
	//
	//204401 "Sleep in the saddle. Drink the rain. Eat nothing but dried meat, dried milk, and horse blood. Such is the life of a Mongol at war."
	//204402 "At night we are rewarded with fermented yak's milk and the promise of Persian treasures."
	//204403 "Driven on by the words of the Great Khan we have crossed miles of the Asian continent at full gallop."
	//204404 "Before us lies the vast empire of Persia."
	//204405 "The Khwarazm Shah will be given one chance to submit, and then his cities will be pulled down, brick by brick. But not all of us head into Persia."
	//204406 "Genghis has sent Tsubotai Ba'atur of the Reindeer People north into Russia. The Russian principalities are disorganized, and Genghis hopes that Tsubotai can break them one by one. Then the horde will rule all of Asia."
	//204451 "The Persian army numbered nearly half a million men, but was beaten by a Mongol army less than half that size. The governors of outlying cities were executed by pouring molten silver into their eyes and throats."
	//204452 "The capital city of Samarkand, which was expected to withstand our siege for a full year, fell in five days. Separate mountains were made of the skulls of men, women, children, horses, dogs, and cats."
	//204453 "We roamed the streets in wonder at the opulence of the Perser, drinking at their fountains and gorging ourselves on sherbet and tropical fruit. For a man born in a tent, it seemed as if Djingis Khan had torn open the gates to Heaven itself."
	//204454 "Russia and Mesopotamia were now ours to command. The empire now stretched over seven thousand miles from the Pacific Ocean to the Black Sea. We were about to enter Europe when tragedy struck."
	//
	//204501 "Old wolves do not die gracefully. Warriors their whole lives, they do not know how to live when they grow old and their fangs fall out. Such it is with Mongoler as well. Djingis Khan was now eighty years old."
	//204502 "On the night when we knew our glorious conquest was about to end, Genghis summoned his sons to his tent."
	//204503 "They found their father shivering before a fire, delirious with pain. 'My descendants will wear gold,' he said, 'they will eat the finest meals and ride the finest horses...and forget to whom they owe it all. A deed is not glorious until it is finished.'"
	//204504 "And he refused to die until Ogedei, his third son, promised to continue the war."
	//204505 "Ogedei emerged from the tent, carrying his father's bow, and declared:"
	//204506 "'This storm is not yet finished, I hear the sound of lightning, and it strikes in Poland.'"
	//204507 "The church bells rang in Europe when they saw our horde pouring out of the mountains. The armies of Bohemia and Germany hastened to Poland's defense."
	//204508 "To them, our army might have been from the underworld itself, still commanded by the shade of the Great Khan."
	//204551 "European riddare fight as individuals, but Mongoler fight as part of a united army. Laden down with rustning, the Polish and Germans could not catch our quick-footed horses."
	//204552 "Time and again, we fired flaming arrows at them, then retreated out of range. When the enemy kavalleri pursued, we would lead them into an ambush."
	//204553 "The ambush was always announced by the naqara, a huge drum carried into battle on a camel. A hundred times a hundred times has the naqara sounded on this day."
	//204554 "We were ordered to cut off an ear of every victim. Nine large sacks of ears were sent back to Ogedei Khan."
	//
	//204601 "Only one power stands in our way. France and the kingdoms beyond are beaten from decades of crusades. If we break Eastern Europe, then it is likely that all of Western Europe will surrender. But, to break the East, we must defeat Hungary."
	//204602 "Hungary possesses the most formidable kavalleri in all of Europe. They have not only the strength of European rustning, but their horses are cousins to our own, having drifted in from across the Russian steppes."
	//204603 "The Sajo River that separates us from the army of Hungary is frozen, so we will be unable to deploy boats. Instead, the battle will be won or lost over who controls the bridge."
	//204604 "Tsubotai is coming with reinforcements. If we can survive the charge of the Hungarian riddare until Tsubotai arrives, then we can hope to take the bridge."
	//204605 "Much rests on this simple bridge. If we capture the Sajo crossing, we capture Hungary. If Hungary falls, so falls Europe. With Europe and Asia under Mongol control, our conquest of the world will be complete and final."
	//204651 "Nothing stands between us and the Atlantic Ocean. The Mongol Empire comprises two whole continents; Europe and Asia belong to the hordes."
	//204652 "Every place we have entered has changed forever with our passing. Russia, once filled with quarreling city-states, much like the old Mongol tribes, will forever be melded into a single, gigantic empire."
	//204653 "Djingis Khan forged the largest empire ever created in the life of one man. His body was carried back to the River Onon, where the legendary Blue Wolf and Fallow Doe once lived. He was buried in the ground, and a thousand horsemen rode over the site to disguise it. Djingis Khan's final resting place was devoured by the steppes."
	//204654 "My people cherish the legend that their great ruler will one day return to lead his horsemen to another bloody victory."

	//
	//// 05 - Barbarossa
	//
	//205101 "So you have come to hear the tale of Fredrik Barbarossa?  Better order us another round. Maybe three. You see ... it is a great tale. But then again, everything about the man was great."
	//205102 "Barbarossa was a man of great appetites ... great ambitions ... and a great, red beard. But the question - the question you want to know - is: Was that enough? Is the will of one man enough to forge an empire?"
	//205103 "For there was no Holy Roman Empire at that time, only a gaggle of quarrelling city-states. These dubiously loyal princedoms were more interested in a loose confederation than a unified empire."
	//205104 "But Barbarossa, he believed that he was the emperor by will of God, and he intended to bring the Holy Roman Empire back to its former glory. If that meant crushing all of the German princes, well, so be it."
	//205151 "They have called Barbarossa the scourge of Europe. But he was as skilled a diplomat as he was a warrior."
	//205152 "He united the German principalities with more than just the sword. He established a set of legal codes known as the Land Peaces. He helped the hungry by fixing an official price for grain after every harvest. The provinces of Germany quickly became the wealthiest and most powerful in Europe."
	//205153 "The Holy Roman Empire was so successful, in fact, that it quickly became strong enough to expand."
	//
	//205201 "The empire was in full bVävstol, and her population was rapidly growing. The people felled forests, drained marshlands, and reclaimed land from the sea itself."
	//205202 "This newfound prosperity made expansion too tempting to resist. Eager to test his military might, Barbarossa set his sights east towards the Kingdom of Poland."
	//205203 "To assist in his invasion, Barbarossa called up one of his mightiest vassals, Henry the Lion.  Henry was a powerful prince of Saxony, and his decadent palaces outshone the emperor's own."
	//205204 "While he swore fealty to Barbarossa, some questioned whether Henry the Lion did not want the Empire for his own."
	//205205 "By ordering Henry the Lion to aid in the subjugation of Poland, Barbarossa meant to test his oath of allegiance once and for all."
	//205251 "Henry expected to be drawn and quartered, the usual fate of traitors in those times. But Barbarossa recognized the potential for a strong ally and officially forgave him, provided that Henry the Lion would swear to support Barbarossa from now on."
	//205252 "Amazingly, Henry agreed."
	//205253 "The Germans were unified, and Henry the Lion was pacified. But the Holy Roman Empire was not complete. Harkening back to Karl den store, the empire claimed ownership of Italy, and especially Rome."
	//
	//205301 "In Rome, the pope firmly believed that it was the church, not the emperor, who was the ultimate authority for the empire. Barbarossa could not convince the pope to see things his way, so he appointed his own pope."
	//205302 "This too was not enough, for pope and antipope promptly excommunicated each other."
	//205303 "In the end, Barbarossa had to resort again to politics at the point of a lance. If the pope would not listen to reason, then perhaps he would concede with two thousand German riddare pouring down the Italian peninsula."
	//205304 "The greatest of the northern cities, the virtual capital of Lombardy, was Milan. The lords of Milan were as proud as they were belligerent."
	//205305 "Barbarossa was determined to raze Milan to the ground as a warning to all the Italian city-states, and particularly the pope in Rome. The message was clear: He, Fredrik Barbarossa, was the one and true Holy Roman Emperor."
	//205351 "Barbarossa was not kind to the Milanese. In response to one attempt at negotiations during the siege, he sent six Italienare marching back to the city."
	//205352 "Five had been blinded, but the sixth only had his nose cut off so that he could lead the other five."
	//205353 "Northern Italy had been mercilessly conquered and placed under Imperial governance. But Italy would not submit. If anything, the destruction of Milan made the Italian cities even more incensed at their would-be emperor."
	//
	//205401 "As long as Barbarossa's riddare were present, peace endured. But the emperor could not be everywhere at once. Whenever he went to Italy, Germany would flare up, and when Barbarossa returned to Germany, the Italienare began plotting again."
	//205402 "Milan had fallen, but the remainder of the Italian cities joined together in a confederation known as the Lombard League, for the purpose of defeating Barbarossa."
	//205403 "If Barbarossa intended to make Italy part of the Holy Roman Empire, he would have to conquer the Lombard League city by city."
	//205404 "But Barbarossa still had a secret weapon: Henry the Lion and his seasoned troops."
	//205451 "Henry the Lion was immediately banished to England. Separated from his wealth and army, there was little more he could do to plague Barbarossa."
	//205452 "After six campaigns down to Italy, Barbarossa was weary of crossing the Alps."
	//205453 "The fighting ended with the signing of the Treaty of Constance, which said effectively that the emperor and the pope were equals."
	//205454 "It was a tenuous peace, and one that seemed unlikely to endure, when suddenly the pope died."
	//205455 "The new pope was less interested in squabbling with the emperor, than he was in events down south. You see, the Europeans were being driven out of the Holy Land. It was time for another Crusade."
	//
	//205501 "The Holy Roman Empire was complete and, for the moment, both Germany and Italy swore fealty to Barbarossa. Alas, the peace was not to endure."
	//205502 "The Crusader states in Palestine were crumbling. A Saracen king named Saladin had evicted virtually every Crusader from their castle. The Pope called for a new Crusade, before the Holy Land became Saracen once again."
	//205503 "Remarkably, Barbarossa agreed to undertake this new Crusade for the pope he had fought so hard against. King Philip of France and England's Rikard Lejonhjärtaed had already boarded ships bound for the Middle East."
	//205504 "But Barbarossa's army was the largest by far, and there wasn't a fleet in Europe that could transport it."
	//205505 "The emperor would have to march overland, to Constantinople and through the land of the Turkar to reach the rendezvous in Jerusalem."
	//205506 "Constantinople was the capital of the Byzantine Empire and one of the most glorious cities on the globe. Barbarossa's army would be able to rest and resupply in Constantinople before it began the great march."
	//205551 "Barbarossa's weary army had marched for hundreds of miles through the cracked mountains in the heat of July. So when it stumbled upon the Göksu River, the men were astonished and grateful. Barbarossa himself could not resist plunging into the cold water without even pausing to remove his rustning."
	//205552 "To the disbelief of the surviving troops, Barbarossa drowned."
	//205553 "Some said the emperor could not swim in his plate rustning. Others believed the sixty-seven-year-old heart had finally given out. Regardless of the exact cause of death, Barbarossa's Crusade ended there, on June 10, 1190. The Holy Roman Emperor was gone."
	//
	//205601 "Barbarossa's soldiers were devastated. Several riddare committed suicide. Others converted and joined the Saracens, so convinced were they that God Himself had deserted them."
	//205602 "However, a handful of riddare were not yet willing to board a ship bound for Europe."
	//205603 "The body of mighty Barbarossa was fished out of the river, pickled in vinegar, and sealed in a barrel. The army of the Holy Roman Empire would not be joining in the Crusade."
	//205604 "Yet there was still a chance for a small victory. The surviving riddare vowed to take Barbarossa's body on to Jerusalem. Even in death, the emperor would keep his promise!"
	//205651 "There is a legend concerning every great king, from Arthur on through Barbarossa, that says the king will return someday when his country needs him. Myths and legends about the sleeping emperor were passed down in German folktales. The Holy Roman Empire did not endure."
	//205652 "She fell back into a patchwork of tiny city-states. Some would say Barbarossa's rule was a failure."
	//205653 "But is it not a greater testament to the man that it was the force of his will alone that held the empire together?"
	//205654 "And what of Henry the Lion?  With Barbarossa gone, there was nothing stopping him from returning to the Holy Roman Empire."
	//205655 "But I am an old man now. What harm could I possibly do?"

	//// 06 - Attila
	//
	//206101 "A severed head on a pike seemed such a grisly trophy to be displayed in the chapel at Châlons.  And yet it took me weeks before I got up the nerve to ask Father Armand why he kept it."
	//206102 "The ancient priest stared out the window for a long time, recalling days gone by.  'I was there,' he said finally.  'At the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields...fighting alongside Aetius and Theodoric the Goth.'  I knew there had been a battle here, decades ago.  Peasants still overturn skeletons and broken shields with their plows from time to time."
	//206103 "'Who was it, Father?'  I asked him.  'Who were you fighting?'  He turned back to regard me, paralyzing me with his old-man's stare.  'Hunnern Attila,' he said.  And then he told me the story."
	//206104 "The Hunner rode out from the wilderness sometime in the 370s, eager to feast on a Roman Empire weak from internal corruption and the expansion of other barbarian tribes."
	//206105 "It was the Hunner who drove many of these other barbarians before them.  They were terrifying warriors from the steppes of Asia, their bodies disfigured from ritual scarring, their legs deformed from a near lifetime in the saddle."
	//206106 "Despite their fearsome aspect, the Hunner might have been little more than raiders, had it not been for the leadership of Attila. He called himself the Scourge of God.  Attila and his brother Bleda led the Hunner not just to raid, but to devastate Scythia and Persia."
	//206151 "I asked Father Armand more about this legendary Hunnern Attila, whom the stories always treat as more of a monster than a man."
	//206152 "'He was a man,' the priest said, 'but he did not look like the Romans, nor did he worship the Roman god.  That was the cause of all that was to follow.'  Father Armand shivered as if from the cold breeze that blew in from the chapel's open windows."
	//206153 "Kingship among the barbarians was not by divine right or lineage, but by who had the strongest will.  Attila was the strongest of the Hunner, and he reinforced his position by brandishing a rusty old blade and proclaiming it to be the Sword of Mars, the old Roman god of war. Attila had a custom of fiercely rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror that he inspired...'"
	//206154 "He had a power over other men, so that many chose to join him.  Many foreigners joined his council, Scythians and Burgunder and Goter. It was not uncommon for Romans to do so as well - several decades prior, the son of a prominent Roman family  had been sent to the Hunner as a hostage to ensure peace.  The name of this boy was Flavius Aetius, a name not soon to be forgotten.'"
	//
	//206201 "Now that the memories had stirred, Father Armand seemed eager to tell his tale.  He explained how the Hunner, like the other barbarians, had a style of warfare dramatically different from the ancient Romans or my own Franker."
	//206202 "The Hunner would charge as one group, often firing arrows as they came, and then suddenly retreat again.  For the nations of Europe, who were used to forming up lines and columns and even issuing challenges for personal combat, this was an aberration.  They were unable to comprehend warfare in this manner."
	//206203 "Barbarians did not conquer lands.  They did not try and hold and colonize the cities they attacked.  Instead, they ravaged and pillaged, and took their loot back to their camps."
	//206204 "By that time, there were two Roman Empires, the government having decided that the Roman lands were simply too vast for one city to manage effectively.  Attila and the Hunner began a series of raids into the Eastern Empire."
	//206251 "The Roman city of Naissus was erased from the earth.  The Hunner so devastated the place that when the Roman ambassadors passed through to meet with Attila, they had to camp outside the city on the river. The riverbanks were covered with human bones, and the stench of death was so great that no one could enter the city. Many cities of Europe would soon suffer the same fate."
	//206252 "The ambassadors that the Romans sent to Attila concealed an assassination attempt."
	//206253 "Somehow, Attila knew of the attempt on his life, and sent the terrified assassin back to his emperor, with the gold he had been paid to do the deed in a sack tied to his neck."
	//206254 "Following such a demonstration, the Hunner had no difficulty convincing the Eastern Roman Empire to start paying them tribute, protection money to stave off the inevitable Hun invasion."
	//
	//206301 "By this time, the Romans had considerable experience dealing with barbarians.  They could civilize the raiders to some extent by offering them otherwise useless land on the Roman borders as a token tribute.  Before Attila, this tactic seemed to be working on the Hunner, who settled in the Danube River valley."
	//206302 "All that changed when Attila seized command.  He was much more aggressive and unpredictable than the previous Hunnic kings.  He demanded that the tributes from Rome be increased and when the Romans refused, Attila made war on the Eastern Roman Empire."
	//206303 "He marched on the great city of Constantinople, whose double walls had never fallen."
	//206304 "Attila was done with raiding.  Now the Hunner advanced slowly, eradicating everything in their path.  The Romans would reinstate the tribute, or they would be destroyed."
	//206351 "'Who was this man?' I asked, 'to threaten the Roman emperor?'"
	//206352 "Titles such as 'Emperor' meant nothing to the Hunner.  Attila was not an appointed ruler, only the strongest among the Hunner.  The amenities of his 'office' meant nothing to him.  While his chieftains and council ate off of silver plates, Attila's own plate and goblet were hewn from simple wood.  His Scythian guards had jewels on their sword hilts and their cloaks were clasped with gold, but Attila showed no such affectations."
	//206353 "He was interested only in conquest.  Some said that he was trying to build a legacy to rival that of Alexander the Great.  All of the barbarians wanted to possess Rome, as if it would buy them instant legitimacy as a world-spanning empire.  Unlike most of the other barbarians, however, Attila was actually going to get his chance."
	//
	//206401 "The Western Roman emperor had a sister named Honoria, who after weary years of confinement to her parlor, made the preposterous decision to send a letter to Hunnern Attila.  She asked him to marry her.  One suspects Honoria did not know what she was getting into."
	//206402 "Attila was plentifully supplied with wives, but he immediately saw the advantage that such a union could put him in.  Suddenly, his plans changed.  He would not invade the Eastern Roman Empire at Constantinople, but the Western Empire, at Rome.  Indeed, he claimed half of the Western Empire as his dowry."
	//206403 "Attila sent the Hunner to march across the Rhine River, and made alliances with the other barbarian chieftains.  Some, namely the Burgunder and Ostrogoths, joined the Hunnic confederation, while others, such as the Visigoths, sought to seek Roman favor by opposing the Hunner."
	//206404 "When Attila entered the Roman province of Gaul, he could claim that he merely sought by force what was his by right of betrothal to Honoria."
	//206451 "The old priest hung his head as he related what happened next, and I could tell the weight of the memories caused him great sorrow."
	//206452 "Attila would stop at nothing until he reached his fiancée, Honoria, and his goal of ruling the Roman Empire.  The ravaging of Gaul was unprecedented."
	//206453 "People were tortured, their bodies torn asunder by wild horses, or their bones crushed under the weight of rolling wagons.  Their unburied limbs were abandoned on the public roads as prey to dogs."
	//206454 "Heads on stakes stretched from Gaul clear back to the Danube River, from whence the Hunner had come.  They lay siege to Orléans, for Attila had learned much of siegecraft since he had faced the walls of Constantinople."
	//206455 "But as the Hunner set to their fell task, a great cloud of dust appeared on the horizon.  Aetius and the Roman army had come."
	//
	//206501 "'And now,' said Father Armand, 'is where I entered the story.'"
	//206502 "The battle between Hun and Roman was fought at the end of June, 451.  The Romans were commanded by Aetius, a brilliant and celebrated general who had been held hostage by the Hunner when he was a boy.  Aetius knew Attila and he knew the Hunnic ways.  Since he had returned to the Western Empire, Aetius had done more than any man to keep Rome alive throughout the period of barbarian invasions."
	//206503 "His army was not large enough to face Attila alone, so Aetius convinced tribes of the Alans and Visigoths to ally with him.  Even though these dubious allies had a common hatred of the Hunner, it was still a remarkable achievement on Aetius' part to have drawn them into an effective military relationship."
	//206504 "The Hunner were eager for battle.  Attila's shamans looked at the entrails of cattle and the color of sheep bones, and prophesized that the Hunner would meet defeat on the Catalaunian Fields.  However, they also foresaw that the commander of the opposing force would be killed."
	//206505 "Attila must have thought this a fair trade, because he brought battle to Aetius and the Goter."
	//206506 "Before blood was drawn, Attila stood before his assembled troops clutching the sword of Mars in his fist.  He told them, 'It is a right of nature to glut the soul with vengeance.  I shall hurl the first spear at the foe.  If any man can stand at rest while Attila fights, he is a dead man.'"
	//206551 "It was a catastrophic battle, one of the largest and greatest the world has ever seen.  The stream was turned to a torrent by the rushing of blood.  I pity those that were forced to slake their thirst from it.  'Cadavera vero innumera', the Romans said afterwards.  'Truly countless bodies.'  Perhaps 300,000 men were left dead on the Catalaunian Fields.  It is said the ghosts of those killed continued to fight for several days."
	//206552 "I passed within inches of the fell Hun king as he stalked the battlefield, trying to determine which of his chieftains and allies yet lived.  When he found me, huddled beneath my shield, I made my peace with God.  But Attila did not seek my decapitation.  He saw that I was a holy man, and ordered me to join his retinue of foreign advisors.  'That is how you know so much of the Hunner,' I offered."
	//206553 "The priest nodded. Despite the carnage, the outcome of the legendary battle was unclear.  Attila had lost much of his cavalry, but the Roman army would never recover from its losses. For a time, no one knew if the Hunnic king would continue to pursue the hand of Honoria.  'But what of the prophecy?'  I asked.  'Did Aetius die on the battlefield?'"
	//206554 "'Nay.  It was Theodoric the Goth, not Aetius, who died and fulfilled the prophecy.  Aetius knew that if he utterly destroyed the Hunner, then the Visigoths would have no need for a Roman alliance and Rome would face yet another barbarian threat."
	//206555 "And so, Aetius retired from military life, hoping that the outcome of the Catalaunian Fields would leave the Hunner and Goter in a stalemate. He hoped he had done enough to save his empire.  He had not."
	//
	//206601 "As far as Attila was concerned, Honoria was waiting with open arms in Rome.  The very next year, partially recovered from his losses, Attila turned his attention to Italy."
	//206602 "The Hunner crossed the Alps and moved down the Italian peninsula, launching another great invasion that terrorized the inhabitants of the Western Roman Empire.  He meant to take Rome, and crown himself emperor."
	//206603 "This was not the Rome of Caesar, mind you, but a withering Rome, beaten from earthquakes and barbarian wars.  And this time, there was no General Aetius to hold off the Hunner' savagery."
	//206651 "The city of Aquileia at the tip of the Adriatic was wiped off the face of the earth. The fugitives from that pitiful city took refuge among the islands, marshes, and lagoons at the head of the Adriatic Sea and there founded the town of Venetia, or Venice."
	//206652 "'But what of the Pope?' I asked."
	//206653 "No one knows what Saint Leo said to the Hunnic king, but that very day Attila turned his army around and started back for the Hun lands on the Danube."
	//206654 "Hunnern Attila died shortly thereafter.  Since he had failed to claim Rome, he could not have Honoria, and instead brought another wife into his harem."
	//206655 "On his wedding night, Attila suffered a nosebleed and choked to death.  For a man who had boasted that 'where my horse has trodden, no grass grows' it was a curiously anti-climactic death."
	//206656 "The Hunnic warriors cut their hair and gashed their faces, so that the king should be lamented, not by tears of maidens, but by the blood of warriors.  Attila's bloody reign of conquest lasted nineteen long years."
	//206657 "Father Armand was silent for a long time.  He glanced over at the head on a stake.  'A Hunnic trophy,' he said.  'I think the man was a Visigoth.  He died at the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields.  I keep it here so that I may see it every day and remember.'  'Remember what, Father?' I asked him."
	//206658 "The scent of a burning village.  The sound of butchery.  The way peasants would flee before the Hun riders.  The way we would ride them down.  The way it felt to conquer alongside Attila and the Hunner."
	//206659 "He leaned so close I could feel his breath.  'Sometimes..."
	//206660 "...I miss it.'"

	//// 07 - El Cid
	//
	//207101 "Enough.  You have troubled me for three blocks now, stranger.  If you agree to cease this dogged pursuit and leave me to my lamentations, then I will answer your relentless questions.  I will tell you why a dead man rides through the streets of Valencia."
	//207102 "You see that castle on the hill?  That is the home of Rodrigo Díaz, whom Moor and Christian alike call 'El Cid'.  It is from the Arabic 'sayyid' which means 'lord'.  He is the greatest man who ever lived."
	//207103 "The Cid was a riddare and loyal vassal of one of the old kings of Spain."
	//207104 "When the old king died, his kingdom was partitioned between his surviving sons, Sancho and Alfonso.  King Sancho ruled Castile, a windswept barren land named for its many border castles.  The Cid continued to serve Castile, and its new king, as was his duty.  The sly king Alfonso ruled Léon, but openly plotted to become king of all of Christian Spain.  There was soon open warfare between Castile and Léon."
	//207105 "The struggle climaxed at the battle of Golpejera, where the Cid attempted to capture the wicked Alfonso."
	//207151 "Although the Cid defeated Alfonso's army in combat, the sly king knew there were more devious ways to win a war.  Alfonso lured his brother, King Sancho, to a secret conference below the city walls of Zamora, and had him assassinated in the night."
	//207152 "With the death of his brother, Alfonso became king of both Leon and Castile--the most powerful king in Christian Spain."
	//207153 "The Cid could not trust King Alfonso, yet he was sworn to serve his king, and that man was now Alfonso."
	//207154 "The Cid forced King Alfonso to swear an oath upon sacred relics that he had nothing to do with Sancho's death.  Before his army and his court, a nervous Alfonso did make this declaration.  In so doing, the Cid helped to cement Alfonso's claim as king in the hearts of the people, for they so trusted the Cid."
	//207155 "King Alfonso did not recognize that the Cid had done him a service.  Instead, Alfonso held a grudge against the man who was the greatest of his riddare for ever doubting him.  Alfonso also was jealous and suspicious of the Cid's popularity with the soldiers and the common man.  He sent the Cid into dangerous battle again and again, but always the Cid emerged victorious."
	//
	//207201 "How do I know so much of my Cid, Rodrigo Díaz?  I am Ximena of Asturias, and I am the Dona of this castle.  Rodrigo and I were married in Castile in 1075.  Those were among the happiest days of my life, at least when my husband was not being sent to do battle against the Moors."
	//207202 "Far to the east, in the Holy Land, they speak of only one Muslim expansion - that of the Seljuk Turkar.  But here, in Spain, we speak of another - the Moors.  The Moors ruled southern Spain for so long that Christian and Muslim often lived side by side with little animosity.  Such was the case in the city of Toledo, which was in Moorish lands, but inhabited by Christians as well."
	//207203 "A political assassination had plunged the city of Toledo into a civil war.  Seeing a chance to expand his empire, King Alfonso struck at Toledo under the pretense of restoring order."
	//207204 "He ordered the Cid to command the army, though one must wonder if once again he was intentionally putting the Cid in harm's way."
	//207251 "Once again, the Cid emerged victorious, and delivered the city to King Alfonso.  Moor and Christian alike shouted his name from the city walls, and called him El Cid Campeador - my lord, the conqueror.  After nearly 400 years of Moorish rule, the city of Toledo was ruled by a Christian king."
	//207252 "But still Alfonso was not satisfied!  He accused the Cid of seeking personal glory at the expense of the crown.  When he heard the peasants shouting the name of the Cid instead of Alfonso's own name, he became even more angered.  I knew then that our contented lives in Castile were about to end."
	//
	//207301 "King Alfonso sent his most loyal and able servant, Rodrigo Díaz, the Cid, into exile with only his horse, Bavieca.  Myself and our two daughters were left at the monastery in Castile."
	//207302 "When Rodrigo and I parted, it felt like a nail being torn from its finger.  Rodrigo rode alone into the Castilian winter."
	//207303 "He was not alone for long.  Everywhere the Cid went, mercenaries and soldiers were eager to follow.  Soon, he had a small army of his own.  But the Cid was not content to wander the wilds of Castile forever."
	//207304 "He needed a castle and a lord to serve.  This too, he found, in the most unlikely of places."
	//207351 "Motamid, Lord of Zaragoza, was a gifted leader of men, but like many of the Moors, he was also a poet and artist.  The cultural achievements of the Moors made the rest of Europe seem barbaric in comparison."
	//207352 "As the Cid parlayed with Lord Motamid in his sumptuous palace, he feasted on meals that came floating down an indoor stream.  Motamid bestowed rich gifts on the Cid, and made him a wealthy man."
	//207353 "But the Cid, ever the loyal servant of Castile, convinced Motamid to ratify a treaty, making Zaragoza part of Castile."
	//207354 "The Cid never fought openly against King Alfonso, though he did make enemies with Count Berenguer and other Spanjorer lords who wanted only tributes of gold from the Moors and were not interested in making alliances with them.  Count Berenguer would remain the Cid's enemy for many years."
	//
	//207401 "King Alfonso watched with alarm as the combined Christian-Moorish forces of the Cid gained power and prestige.  Finally, he could stand it no longer, and sent his own army against Motamid's Moors at Zaragoza."
	//207402 "As much as he would have liked to come to the assistance of his friend Motamid, the Cid could not draw steel against King Alfonso, as he was still the Cid's rightful lord."
	//207403 "Since the Cid could not assist him, Motamid was forced to seek help elsewhere. When he contacted the Almoravid Berber who lived beyond the sea in Gibraltar, however, he received more than he bargained for."
	//207404 "These veiled religious zealots waged a continuous jihad across the barren dunes of the Sahara."
	//207405 "Their leader, the fanatical Yusuf who never showed his face, immediately prepared to cross the ocean into Spain with thousands of men and camels.  King Alfonso's army was certain to crumble beneath this new wave of invaders."
	//207451 "Alfonso needed only have mentioned that Spain was in jeopardy, and the Cid would have come!  And when the Cid did finally come to his king's aid, the Berber were crushed, and their leader, Yusuf, was forced to flee back to Africa."
	//207452 "The Cid bowed to Alfonso, ready to return to his rightful place as the king's champion.  But King Alfonso was angered that the Cid had not arrived sooner and ordered him to return to his exile."
	//207453 "This time he seized the Cid's wife and children.  Many long years did I rot in the dungeons of Castile."
	//
	//207501 "The Cid was in exile again, and this time there were no more Moors to welcome him in.  He wandered the bleak rocks of Castile and wondered if his tale was finally at an end."
	//207502 "And yet, a remarkable thing happened.  Many mercenaries and riddare knew of the tales of the Cid, and were eager to follow him, even without a castle.  As the Cid wandered further south, more men, Christian and Muslim, joined his army.  Eventually, the Cid had a large enough force to carve out a fiefdom of his own."
	//207503 "King Alfonso had set his sights on beautiful Valencia, the jewel of the Moorish coast.  But the Cid was closer and could get there sooner."
	//207504 "If he conquered Valencia, the Cid would have protection not only from the machinations of Alfonso, but also a bulwark against the inevitable second invasion of Yusuf and the Berber."
	//207505 "Events would have unfolded simply then, had not our old enemy, Count Berenguer of Barcelona, picked that moment to strike back at the Cid."
	//207551 "How abundant the oräckvidd groves and olive trees seemed to the conquerors who had come from bleak Castile.  Valencia was a tropical paradise, complete with palm trees, a silk market and abundant fish and waterfowl."
	//207552 "After the Cid had secured the castle and saw to the defenses of the city, he sent for me and the children.  Our reunion took place on the highest tower of the castle, before a sea that consumed the entire horizon."
	//207553 "We turned Valencia into our own kingdom, uniting eight-thousand Christian and twenty-thousand Moorish soldiers.  It was the greatest of the Cid's accomplishments to date."
	//207554 "We were far away from the reach of King Alfonso, and Count Berenguer himself was safely locked in Valencia's dungeons.  In time, he would be ransomed, and one of our daughters married to his nephew and heir, to ward against future conflicts."
	//207555 "If only the tale of the Cid had ended there, beneath the Valencian sunsets.  But it was not to be. Valencia lay right in the path of the advancing horde of the frenzied Yusuf and his Berber warriors."
	//
	//207601 "We were trapped and alone in our kingdom of Valencia.  The Cid immediately sent out messages for potential allies, but there were few to be found.  The Christian kingdom of Aragon was too far away, and King Alfonso of Castile seemed in no hurry to come to the Cid's defense."
	//207602 "Even the Cid's old ally, Motamid the Moor, was of no avail.  Yusuf had sent him into exile in the Sahara Desert, where he spent the rest of his sad days composing poetry."
	//207603 "The Berber rode around the city for ten days and nights, shrieking and banging their weapons on shields made of hippopotamus hide.  But the Cid comforted his troops, prayed and planned a counterattack."
	//207604 "And then the unthinkable happened.  During a brilliant surprise attack to capture gold and horses from the Berber, Rodrigo Díaz, my Cid, was shot by a stray arrow.  The surprise attack became a rout, and the Cid's men barely made it back to the castle with his broken body."
	//207605 "Rodrigo and I knew he would not last the night.  But we also knew that without their Cid to lead them, the soldiers of Valencia would never have the strength to stand against the Berber."
	//207606 "So as he breathed his last breath, I strapped my husband onto his horse, Bavieca, and placed his sword, Tizon, in his hand. Bavieca stood out above the city of Valencia."
	//207607 "My one hope was that the men would not realize the charade -- realize that their Cid was already dead."
	//207651 "It was the twilight of Moorish Spain.  The Berber army had been broken and Valencia withstood the siege."
	//207652 "King Alfonso would not allow us to bury the Cid until he could personally attend the funeral.  When he arrived, he dispelled all thoughts of interring the Cid into the earth."
	//207653 "Instead, the Cid's body was preserved and placed near the altar of the church, seated on an ivory stool that he had captured from the Moors, clothed in precious silk, and holding his sword, Tizon, in his left hand."
	//207654 "And who was left to rule in Valencia?  King Alfonso of Castile or Count Berenguer of Barcelona?  No. Valencia is mine."
	//207655 "It is I, Ximena Díaz who claims rulership of my dead husband's kingdom.  And if the Berber return to Valencia, it is I whom they shall find commanding the soldiers of Rodrigo Díaz, El Cid Campeador!"

	//// 08 - Montezuma
	//
	//208101 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, Örnkrigare of Tenochtitlan.  An omen appeared above the forest, the shape of an ear of corn, but blazing like daybreak.  It seemed to bleed fire, drop by drop, like a wound in the sky.  I am a warrior, not a priest, and knew not what to make of such a sign."
	//208102 "I consulted with the seers and magicians to see if another great war was coming, but they answered only in riddles.  'The gods want more sacrifice,' was their answer.  That was always their answer."
	//208103 "Much of our empire of rainforests and volcanoes has been conquered in the name of sacrifice.  The magicians tell us that we must make a sacrifice every single day for the sun to continue to rise."
	//208104 "It took the relay teams two full days to carry my message the two hundred miles to our city of Tenochtitlan.  After two more days, my uncle, Montezuma, emperor of the Azteker, sent his reply."
	//208105 "Montezuma's priests foretold that the god Quetzalcoatl might soon return from his long exile.  How else to explain the omen?"
	//208106 "Montezuma ordered my warriors to increase their efforts to consolidate the rainforest between our lands and those of our enemies. We must establish control over four shrines that are sacred to Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent."
	//208107 "Because the Aztec Empire is mighty and constantly expands, we have made many enemies. We must defend these shrines from our enemies in order to prepare for Quetzalcoatl's eventual return."
	//208151 "When my warriors had captured the shrines and defeated the Xochimilco and Tlatiluco, we made the long journey back to Tenochtitlan, laden with gifts for Emperor Montezuma: jade, feathers, and, of course, prisoners."
	//208152 "The sheer vastness of our city on the lake seemed staggering after having been in the rainforest for so many days."
	//208153 "Emperor Montezuma lives in the most sumptuous rooms of the palace with his wives and concubines.  While we spoke, he drank frothing chocolate from a golden cup.  Musicians played their drums and flutes and masked women danced."
	//208154 "When my uncle, Montezuma, first ascended the great pyramid many years ago to become emperor, there was a great celebration.  Yet now some question his leadership.  He sometimes makes decisions slowly, and rarely does he lead the warriors into combat."
	//208155 "Montezuma's priests informed us that Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent, would soon return to Tenochtitlan to reclaim his kingdom.  Since I had helped prepare for his coming, I was given a new obsidian macana and promoted to the rank of Jaguarkrigare.  There was more feasting and dancing that night.  The air was Tung with perfume."
	//208156 "However, I noticed as I walked down the steps of the emperor's palace that the omen still hung heavily over the lake, spraying sparks over the midnight sky.  So says Cuauhtémoc, Jaguarkrigare of Tenochtitlan."

	//208201 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, Jaguarkrigare of Tenochtitlan.  The gods were still uneasy, for another omen appeared that same year.  The temple of the demon Huitzilopochtli burst suddenly into flame, although it was made of stone.  When the people hurried to pour water on the fire, it burned with even greater violence."
	//208202 "I asked our emperor Montezuma what we needed to do to appease the gods.  His haughty priests made the predictable reply.  The Aztec Empire needed more prisoners.  The sun god, the rain god, and even the Feathered Serpent, Quetzalcoatl, were angry deities that required sacrifice."
	//208203 "Our city-state of Tenochtitlan is allied with two others, together composing the Triple Alliance.  Montezuma intended for the Triple Alliance to attack our longtime enemies, the Tlaxcala."
	//208204 "I sent the traditional shield, arrows and cloaks to the Tlaxcala, declaring to them that they would soon be attacked.  Then we marched out into the forests, our jaguar and eagle banners ready to clash with the heron banners of the Tlaxcala."
	//208205 "Birds in the rainforest canopy took to the sky, eager to be away from the violence that was to come."
	//208251 "The first messengers to arrive in Tenochtitlan told of mountains or torn that floated on the sea.  Each story told to Montezuma was more fantastic than the last: they could fire stone balls, shooting sparks and raining fire that could crack open weapons."
	//208252 "Huge deer with no antlers carried these gods on their backs.  Their swords were iron, their bows were iron, their shields were iron, and their clothes were iron.  Surely this was the return of Quetzalcoatl!"
	//208253 "Montezuma heard these reports with growing alarm, as he shifted nervously on the icpalli, his legless throne.  He ordered expensive gifts to be sent to the new arrivals, in the hopes that Quetzalcoatl would spare Montezuma when the Feathered Serpent came to Tenochtitlan."
	//208254 "'He has come back,' Montezuma whispered to me.  'He seeks his place on the throne, for that is what he promised when he departed.'  I held my weapons tightly but said nothing.  How could I challenge the word of our emperor?  So says Cuauhtémoc, Jaguarkrigare of Tenochtitlan."
	//
	//208301 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, Jaguarkrigare of Tenochtitlan.  Another omen.  The lake around the great city of Tenochtitlan rose and boiled.  It foamed until it washed against the houses of the city, sweeping many of them into the lake."
	//208302 "I accompanied our dignitaries to meet with the new arrivals.  We journeyed towards the coast, through the lands of our enemies, the Tlaxcala.  When we emerged from the forest, the strangers welcomed us, although they kept their weapons nearby."
	//208303 "I told them that we were Azteker, representatives of the great Montezuma.  Their leader said that his people were Spanjorer and he named himself Cortéz, although he seemed pleased when we referred to him as Quetzalcoatl.  Although their skydd and animals seemed otherworldly, they did not seem like gods to me."
	//208304 "We presented Cortéz gifts of finest cotton and plumes of bird feathers, but he seemed more interested in the gold ornaments.  He asked again and again if there was more gold to be found in Tenochtitlan."
	//208305 "By now, Cortéz had advanced all the way to the lands of the Tlaxcala.  There was initial warfare made between Tlaxcala and the Spanjorer.  However, when Cortéz heard stories about the size of Tenochtitlan, and the numbers of our brave Aztec warriors, he suggested that the Spanjorer and Tlaxcala join forces and attack the Azteker."
	//208351 "Although the Aztec warriors fought well that day, my men were frightened by the beasts that the Spanjorer rode into combat, and by the noise of their exploding weapons.  Although we had survived the attack, I thought it best to withdraw towards Tenochtitlan and share with Emperor Montezuma all that we had learned."
	//208352 "I do not know if my uncle, Montezuma, was being cowardly or merely trying to preserve us from the wrath of the gods, but he sent more gifts to Cortéz along with an invitation to visit our great city as his personal guest."
	//208353 "I was there when Montezuma met Cortéz on one of the causeways leading into our great city.  The Spanjorer had evidently never seen anything like Tenochtitlan, and they stared in wonder at the brightly colored markets and pyramids rising out of a man-made island in the middle of gigantic Lake Texcoco."
	//208354 "Some of the Spanjorer soldiers asked whether it was all a dream, the first glimpse of things never heard, seen or dreamed before."
	//208355 "Montezuma led Cortéz to the top of the Great Pyramid, where he pointed out the various canals and neighborhoods of the city, but Cortéz was mostly interested in gold ornaments, and helped himself to any which he encountered.  I was no longer convinced that this man was Quetzalcoatl.  So says Cuauhtémoc, Jaguarkrigare of Tenochtitlan."
	//
	//208401 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, prisoner of Tenochtitlan.  The next omen we did not see, but heard: the voice of a weeping woman who cried in the night that she could not hide her children."
	//208402 "Indecision plagued Emperor Montezuma.  Was this man Quetzalcoatl, or was he just a man?  As the emperor brooded, the citizens grew restless.  Cortéz kept a close watch on the emperor, and soon Montezuma became a prisoner in his own palace.  Thus did the Spanjorer take Tenochtitlan without a siege."
	//208403 "The Spanjorer collected all of the gold that they could find.  They were not interested in our art or ornaments, but merely melted down the gold for the return to Spain."
	//208404 "They also outlawed any further sacrifice to the gods.  When the priests protested, they were killed."
	//208405 "The citizens and warriors of Tenochtitlan were enraged.  We knew, even if our emperor did not, that these men were not gods."
	//208406 "Riots broke out in the marketplaces and at the palace.  When Montezuma himself appeared on the walls urging the Azteker to be at peace, the people threw stones at him.  It was time to remove these so-called gods from Tenochtitlan!"
	//208451 "The Spanjorer called it la noche triste, which meant 'the night of sorrows' in their language.  At first, the Spanjorer barricaded themselves in our homes and palaces, but we continuously attacked their quarters."
	//208452 "With stones, slings and arrows, we drove the Spanjorer and Tlaxcalans through the streets of Tenochtitlan and across the three bridges and over the walls into Lake Texcoco."
	//208453 "Thousands died.  Those Spanjorer that were not killed by macanas or javelins were drowned by the weight of the treasure they refused to leave behind.  Tenochtitlan lay in ruin, but the city was ours again."
	//208454 "Many brave Aztec warriors died that night as well, including noble Montezuma.  The Spanjorer claimed that our own people had killed him with thrown stones.  Thus it was a night of sorrows for us as well.  So says Cuauhtémoc, defender of Tenochtitlan."
	//
	//208501 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, Emperor of Tenochtitlan.  The death of Montezuma only served to further inflame the fury of my people.  I planned to lead the attack personally against the Spanjorer.  'That is as it should be, Cuauhtémoc,' the priests told me, 'for you are now our emperor.'"
	//208502 "I took my place on the icpalli throne and the headdress of the emperor was placed upon my head.  A crown is never a comfortable thing to wear."
	//208503 "Cortéz had still not made it far from Tenochtitlan, for the Spanjorer were weighed down with our stolen gold.  As they fled around the shores of the lake, my warriors pursued them in canoes."
	//208504 "I sent additional warriors by land, for it was obvious now that Cortéz was attempting to flee back to the safety of his allies in Tlaxcala.  We caught up with the Spanjorer on the north side of Lake Texcoco."
	//208551 "I hoped that the surviving Spanjorer on the edge of the lake could see as their captured comrades were dragged up the steps of the great pyramid.  Perhaps they would then understand why we feared the wrath of the Feathered Serpent, Quetzalcoatl.  Perhaps they would know fear as well."
	//208552 "With the fighting having subsided, there was much work to be done.  Our city had suffered much from the Spanjorer occupation and the fighting in the streets.  The priests set out to repair the temples, for the Spanjorer had cast down the idols that we had placed there."
	//208553 "We began a celebration to give thanks to the gods when a great plague struck Tenochtitlan.  Many of our people became helpless and could only lie on their beds.  Many others died."
	//208554 "We did not know if the gods were still unhappy with us, or if this was some weapon unleashed by the Spanjorer.  Regardless, if Cortéz returned, he would find a much weakened city.  I could not let that happen.  So says Cuauhtémoc, Emperor of Tenochtitlan."
	//
	//208601 "Passed down to you by Cuauhtémoc, Emperor of Tenochtitlan.  The Spanjorer will return soon.  I had hoped that Cortéz would continue fleeing back from whence he came, but he stopped to regroup at Tlaxcala.  I imagine that he could not stand the thought of returning to Spain while we still had treasuries of gold hidden from him.  Still dreaming of gold and glory, the Spanjorer pledged themselves to another assault on Tenochtitlan."
	//208602 "In Tlaxcala, Cortéz constructed many war boats on dry land.  Then he had the crafts broken down and carried through the rain forest, only to be rebuilt on Lake Texcoco."
	//208603 "He knows that my Aztec warriors can defend the bridges leading into Tenochtitlan, but we are vulnerable from the water."
	//208604 "I called the warriors to one final battle.  The priests attempted to encourage the troops by calling upon the Azteker to defend their ancient gods and their glorious city."
	//208605 "They sent up smoke signals to declare that the Azteker were ready for war as I climbed the steps of the great temple and sounded the shell trumpet.  Tenochtitlan would be under siege soon, and the brave Azteker would die before we would see her captured."
	//208651 "Not so long ago, some five hundred thousand people called Tenochtitlan home.  It is difficult to recall that this smoking ruin was once an endless city.  Yet, we will rebuild.  We created this island upon which our city and temples stand, and we can do it once more."
	//208652 "The Aztec Empire has endured its greatest challenge.  Yet, the Spanjorer may return in the future.  I am not certain that there is a place for us in this new world.  I could ask the gods for a hint of the future, but no doubt that would lead to more sacrifice and I think there has been enough death for now.  My people composed a poem to commemorate this great war that we have survived, and yet perhaps still not won:"
	//208653 "Broken spears lie in the roads. We have torn our hair in our grief.  The houses are roofless now, and their walls are red with blood...so says Cuauhtémoc, Emperor of Tenochtitlan."

	//// 09-1 - Tours
	//
	//209101 "It is impossible to imagine the world ending on such a fine fall day. Yet the storm of Muslim horsemen continues to rage throughout Europe, leaving conquered cities and shattered armies stunned in its wake. The lighting-quick strikes of the Muslim horsemen break the city of Bordeaux and then Poitiers, leaving precious little of the Frankish Kingdom to defend."
	//209102 "Yet Karl Martell gathers the disheartened Frankish army for one last stand at the city of Tours."
	//209103 "Arabic horses, bred for speed and beauty, begin to splash across the Vienne River. Martel's riddare and swordsmen, trudging under the weight of iron mail, struggle to interpose themselves between the Muslims and the city of Tours."
	//209104 "Carrion birds circle in the air, anticipating the savagery to come.  The rest of Europe watches anxiously, for this is the climax of the Muslim invasion and the last stand of Christian Europe."
	//209151 "The soul of the Frankish army was its riddare, but Karl Martell knew that his cavalry-undisciplined, buried under weight of weapons and rustning-could not match the swiftness of the Muslim riders. Therefore, he ordered the riddare to dismount and join ranks with the Frankish swordsmen to form a tight shield wall."
	//209152 "The Muslims had always conquered with swift offensiveness and were not equipped to counter the Franker' defensive strategy. The arrows of the Muslim skyttar bounced harmlessly off the Tung Frankish rustning, and the light Muslim kavalleri could not breach the human chain."
	//209153 "Battered and bleeding, the invaders broke ranks and fled back to the Pyrenees and the protection of Spain. From Karl Martell's Frankish kingdom eventually grew the Holy Roman Empire, making him the founding father of both Germany and France."

	//// 09-2 - Vinlandsaga
	//
	//209201 "In the gVävstol, the longhouse feels empty, but it is filled with the odors of rust, tar, and animal fur, and the snoring of dogs.  It is the man named Erik who speaks, smacking scarred fingers together for emphasis, the steam of his breath mingling with the wood smoke."
	//209202 "He fills the men's heads with legends of exploration and raiding, of a sea that eats longboats and an undiscovered country ripe for Viking occupation.  He tells the Vikingar that they can leave their frigid homeland and sail across the endless Sea of Worms to a new world brimming with wild grain, grapes, and tall trees."
	//209203 "To the Vikingar, he speaks of paradise, and of course the grizzled Norsemen are always eager for adventure.  When he asks for volunteers, men slam their weapons on tables and shout his name in the cold air.  Erik den Röde smiles."
	//209251 "Much of the Viking history is recorded in oral accounts called sagas passed down through generations.  Two of the most famous sagas are reserved for the adventures of Erik den Röde and his men, who crossed the mighty sea in tiny ships to forge a new Viking sovereignty."
	//209252 "Vinland, as the new world was called, was not kind to the Vikingar.  Although they lacked the iron weapons of the Norsemen, the native Skraelings were fierce warriors who fought relentlessly to defend their homeland against the Norse invaders."
	//209253 "The vastness of the North Atlantic cut the Vikingar in Newfoundland off from their homeland, and they suffered many long years while trying to establish their new colony."
	//
	//// 09-3 - Hastings
	//
	//209301 "Mercenaries and Norman riddare look dubiously at the ships that wobble in the black, fog-choked sea.  What man is this Hertig William to put so many horses on leaky transports?  William ignores their questioning glances and stares across the channel in the direction of England."
	//209302 "Edward the Confessor is dead, and now three men claim rulership of England. Harold the Saxon sits on the English throne and even now hastens to fortify his shores against two invasions."
	//209303 "Harald Hårdråde, King of Denmark and Norway, sends Vikingar from the north as William invades from the south.  The outcome of this three-way conflict is as murky as the fog that shrouds the English Channel."
	//209304 "Harold the Saxon's huskarls are professional soldiers, not mercenaries.  William's only chance is to use Tung cavalry. To do so, he must first get all of these horses onto these unreliable boats.  The future of England is about to be decided ..."
	//209351 "Harold the Saxon's huskarls looked certain to defend the crown for him as they fought the Vikingar to a bloody stalemate at Stamford Bridge.  Despite his losses, Harold marched his exhausted troops south to meet William the Conqueror near Hastings."
	//209352 "William's skyttar and pikemen were no match for Harold the Saxon's veteran huskarls.  Harold even broke the charge of William's riddare.  William himself went down in the fray, and as rumors of his death spread, the Normans turned to flee."
	//209353 "William was not dead, however, and he rallied his troops by throwing aside his helmet so they could see his clean-shaven face and know that he was alive.  William and his rustninged riddare rode down the huskarls, breaking the Saxon force, and continued their ride all the way to London. William was crowned king on Christmas Day."
	//209354 "Because his reign eventually ushered England into a position of unprecedented world leadership, the year 1066 became established as the most famous date in English history."

	//// 09-4 - Manzikert
	//
	//209401 "Minarets of dust twist upwards as horse hooves strike the fractured earth.  Thousands of Seljuk Turkar stream across the Anatolian Plateau to converge on the walled town of Manzikert, which was recently recaptured by the Byzantine army."
	//209402 "The Bysantiner are the heirs of Rome, and their rustninged cataphracts and legions of disciplined swordsmen can smash aside the light rustninged Turkish horse skyttar--provided they can catch them. However, an unlikely turn of events has greatly improved the Turkar' chances for victory."
	//209403 "The Byzantine army is wracked by treachery and deceit from within. One day, a band of mercenaries deserts the Bysantiner.  On another, the army's second in command leads a treacherous conspiracy against the commanding general."
	//209404 "If the Turkar can somehow turn the splintering factions against the Byzantine army, they may overcome a better-equipped and better-trained enemy."
	//209451 "As long as the sun was in the sky, the Byzantine army could fight the Turkar back towards their camp.  When dusk settled over Anatolia, however, the Turkar could harass the ponderous Byzantine kavalleri as it withdrew to Manzikert."
	//209452 "When they could stand no more of this torment, the Byzantine flanks collapsed into a full rout and the Turkish horse skyttar pounced for a quick kill."
	//209453 "The Battle of Manzikert was not lost due to the poor performance of soldiers or commanders, but through Byzantine treachery. Deceit from within the armies disrupted the chain of command, as factions feuding for control of the throne in Constantinople betrayed their armies at the front."
	//209454 "A much-weakened Byzantium was then forced to call to the rest of the Christian West for help, leading to the Crusades.  The Byzantine Empire lingered for another four centuries, but in only a shadow of its former glory."

	//// 09-5 - Agincourt
	//
	//209501 "The rains come again, until there is nothing left of road, wood, or field, nothing in the entire world but mud. The exhausted English soldiers hoist their longbows over their heads, trying to protect the precious yew wood from the water."
	//209502 "The empty wagons can scarcely roll forward, even though all of the supplies have long been eaten.  Terrifying hoof beats resound from the rear.  The French riddare have come."
	//209503 "The English have been in a slow retreat ever since the debacle at Harfleur, where King Henry the Fifth's glorious siege dragged on and on, costing the lives of 3000 Englishmen."
	//209504 "Now, Henry has all but abandoned his dream of establishing his hereditary claim to the French crown.  Like his men, he only wants to reach Calais and the ships that will return them home to England."
	//209505 "On the road back to Calais, the French army overtakes Henry.  Knowing that the English are fatigued, starving, and outnumbered three to one, the French have no interest in negotiation.  The English make their stand on a wooded hilltop."
	//209506 "The skyttar plant stakes in the ground to offer some barrier against the deadly French cavalry."
	//209507 "Henry's only hope is that his lightly-rustninged infanteri prove more nimble than the impetuous French riddare, and that the räckvidd of his skyttar can even the odds before the French horses are upon them."
	//209551 "The Battle of Agincourt is remembered not because it was an inevitable triumph, but because it was an upset.  Outnumbered English longbows were victorious over French riddare only because the riddare had to charge up a muddy hill through a dense forest."
	//209552 "The English wore little skydd and were able to catch the encumbered French in the middle of their retreat.  A charge by Henry and his surviving kavalleri pushed aside the beaten French and opened the road to the coast."
	//209553 "Despite his victory, Henry did not follow through on his attack, but withdrew to England.  The true winner of the battle was Burgundy, which was able to come to power in a vacuum emptied by both the English and the French."

	//// 09-6 - Lepanto
	//
	//209601 "The steady splashing of the oars of 200 ships striking the water drowns out all other sound.  The most powerful fleet ever assembled by Don Juan of Austria and his allies in Venice sails under the burning light of dawn towards a final encounter with the Ottoman Turkar."
	//209602 "The Turkish army has greatly expanded its empire, adding North Africa and Mesopotamia to the Turkish holdings in Anatolia, but has finally been turned back by a staunch defense of Hungary."
	//209603 "Undaunted, the Turkar turn their attention to the Mediterranean, where they intend to break the Christian naval powers of Venice and Spain."
	//209604 "Now, 200 rowed galärer and six Tung galleasses lumber into the Bay of Lepanto to meet the 270 galärer of the Turkish fleet.  The ships draw up with scarcely five miles separating the distance between them.  A storm of arrows darkens the sky, and the drone of splashing oars is finally drowned out by the thunder of cannon."
	//209651 "The Tung Venetian galleasses broke through the Turkish lines and trampled over the smaller ships of the Turkar, but there were too few of the galleasses to win the battle on their own.  The Spanjorer and Venetians attempted to grapple and board the Turkish ships, where the superior experience and weapons of the Christian sailors could be brought to bear."
	//209652 "As the day wore on, the Turkish juggernaut began to run out of strength.  Scores of Turkish galärer were dashed on the rocks and others sank to the bottom of the bay.  Less than fifty Turkish ships survived the battle."
	//209653 "Lepanto was not the climax of the conflict between the Christians and the Turkar on the Mediterranean, but it was a turning point.  The Turkar had difficulty rebuilding their fleet back to its former size, while the Christians continued to update their fleets with the latest technological advancements, ensuring a decisive military advantage for further encounters on the high seas."

	//// 09-7 - Kyoto
	//
	//209701 "The ships slide through a mirror-flat ocean stained red with spring seaweed.  Columns of rock improbably draped with pine trees tower out of the mist.  The men on the ships watch silently as the samurai prowl the deck above.  They will make land near Kyoto and their lord, Hideyoshi, will lead the siege of the city of ten-thousand shrines."
	//209702 "Within Kyoto, rebels hold prisoner Lord Nobunaga--the man who would unify Japan. The islands of Japan remain a patchwork of bickering samurai warlords who still settle conflicts with ritualized duels.  Nobunaga seeks to forge a single Japan, dragging the provincial samurai into the modern era."
	//209703 "Like his master Nobunaga, Hideyoshi wins his battles by volleys of muskets, fully exploiting the firearms recently introduced by Portugiser sailors. Hideyoshi intends no bargaining--he will demand once for Nobunaga's release, and then storm the city."
	//209751 "Kyoto paid dearly for Nobunaga's death, and in the end, Hideyoshi was able to accomplish what his mentor could not--by 1590, Japan was a unified country.  Great though it was, this accomplishment did not satisfy Hideyoshi, who then set about on an ambitious plan to conquer China and Korea."
	//209752 "Japan was not free of conflict, as civil wars continued to rise and fall for many years.  However, the Ieyasu family, former allies of Hideyoshi, continued to rule Japan as Shoguns until the 19th century."

	//// 09-8 - Noryang Point
	//
	//209801 "The haze of spent gunpowder hangs over the gravel-strewn beach, confusing the seabirds that nest on the rocky outcroppings of Chinhae Bay.  As soon as the winds of the Eastern Sea disrupt the cloud, the Japaner navy will return, cannons blazing at the seawalls and what remains of the Korean fleet.  Although the army has so far managed to repel any of the samurai that have waded ashore, it is only a matter of time before the Japaner are victorious."
	//209802 "The last hope for the Korean navy is an innovative commander named Yi Sun-shin.  Admiral Yi is constructing a secret weapon--a ship with iron skydd that can withstand the Japaner cannon and a spiked hull to repel boarders.  He calls these ships Kobukson, or Sköldpaddsfartyg.  If Admiral Yi can ready his fleet of Sköldpaddsfartyg in time, then the Koreaner stand a chance of defeating the Japaner.  On the other hand, if he is too late..."
	//209851 "The Japaner were unable to establish a base in either China or Korea.  Therefore, all supplies and reinforcements had to come from the Japaner islands themselves.  Once Admiral Yi destroyed the Japaner navy, the samurai armies were left isolated, and the invasion ended."
	//209852 "Yi Sun-shin died in the battle, but the Japaner commander, Hideyoshi, died soon after, and with him, the lust for Japaner conquest.  The possibility of a Japaner empire in eastern Asia in the 16th century died under the guns of slow, but deadly, rustninged Korean warships."

	//
	//210101 "Each night I have the same two visions. One of a field of wheat stalks swaying in the wind..."
	//210102 "... another of bright burning flames, trampling horse hooves, and loud screams."
	//210103 "My people, the Visigoths, came to Roman lands not as an invading army, but as a people running from a scourge... No! A plague sent by God himself!"
	//210104 "We warned the Romans of the impending danger, but they ignored us. They despised and distrusted our kind. They treated us poorly, gave us barren lands, and when we suffered famine they made us sell our children for food. Inevitably, we went to war, and our great army struck a decisive blow to the Romans at Hadrianople. We slew their emperor and forced them to allow our people to settle in Roman lands."
	//210105 "Our victory taught the Romans to not underestimate Gothic warriors. In exchange for the land they gave us, our young men would serve in the Roman armies, fighting alongside our former enemies. As wars broke out between the eastern and western halves of the empire, we gathered our spears and served Rome in battle."
	//210151 "The dead bodies of young Goth warriors littered the flanks of the Julian Alps."
	//210152 "For all the blood we shed, the Romans did not give us even a crumb of gratitude. A Gothic commander in the Roman army encouraged us to desert and go back to our people. 'Hardship is upon your families, wives, and children, and your people need your help now more than ever,' he said."
	//210153 "Few had heard of Alaric, this Gothic commander, but he managed to gain a strong reputation during his service in the Roman army. He was a tall man with a voice that could silence a crowd. When Alaric spoke, all heads turned in his direction and his eyes flickered with an inextinguishable fire."
	//
	//210201 "The elders of the Visigothic tribes elected Alaric king of the Visigoths. Never before had there been a single king, but never before had there been a man like Alaric."
	//210202 "We were drawn into another war with Rome. The Romans had failed to fulfill their promises of lands for our families and Alaric was determined to force them to remember their promises. He marched our army south into Greece; 'The days the Romans ignored the Visigoths are over!' he declared. 'We will set fire to Hellas!'"
	//210251 "Ancient cities - once renowned for their philosophers and soldiers - were sacked and burned to ash. The world was changing rapidly, but Alaric had seen visions."
	//210252 "Despite our victories, the eastern Romans still refused to meet our envoys. Instead, we turned west. The half-Vandal general, Stilicho, was the driving power behind the Western Roman Empire. He knew Alaric from when our king served the Romans. We hoped Stilicho would be more willing to negotiate."
	//
	//210301 "Rumors spread that Stilicho was ready to make a deal with Alaric. Our hopes were raised, but as weeks passed with no news, we knew that more Gothic blood would have to be shed."
	//210302 "The Romans resented Stilicho for making a pact with 'barbarians.' When parts of the Western Roman Empire were overrun by usurpers and foreign invaders, they blamed Stilicho. He soon learned the hefty price of Roman politics: they declared him an enemy of the state and had him executed."
	//210303 "In a frenzy of hate, the Romans followed Stilicho's execution by murdering all soldiers of Germanic descent. Then, in another rush of blind rage, they turned on the families of those soldiers, and murdered them too."
	//210304 "The survivors flocked to Alaric, begging him to raise his army and march with them into Italy to exact vengeance."
	//210305 "Alaric coldly answered them, 'The Romans have never known fear, but that will change.'"
	//210351 "For all that the Romans did to us, it seemed logical for Alaric to seek their downfall, but that is not what he wanted. After sacking the cities of Northern Italy, he met with the Roman emperor, Honorius. Alaric's demands were reasonable and humble, a sign of reconciliation between our two peoples. And all would have gone well, had it not been for the Gothic commander Sarus."
	//210352 "Sarus had vied with Alaric over the Visigothic kingship and had lost dishonorably, instead entering Roman service. Jealous of Alaric, he ordered his soldiers to attack our king by surprise and kill him."
	//210353 "Luckily, Alaric and his men survived the assassination attempt, and escaped."

	//210401 "Never had I seen Alaric lose his temper, but Sarus' betrayal infuriated him. He ordered me, his brother-in-law, to commence the siege of Rome."
	//210402 "The walls of Rome were huge and had not been breached since Brennus and his Gauls. However years of decline had weakened the city and its walls were badly in need of repairs."
	//210403 "Inciting the men to battle, Alaric vowed, 'If the Romans want fire and steel, it is fire and steel that we will give them!'"
	//210451 "During the long weeks spent besieging Rome, Alaric's calm nature returned. He issued an order to the warriors to spare the city when conquered. In his heart, he could not find the will to destroy the empire he had served, though it had betrayed him one too many times."
	//210452 "Our brave soldiers breached the walls and the defenses quickly crumbled before the weight of Visigothic men rushing into the breaches."
	//210453 "Our men looted the city for days. We stripped statues and monuments of their gold, and loaded carts with so many precious goods that the wheels were close to breaking. At the end of the third day, a caravan of ox-drawn wagons carrying plunder could be seen as far as the eye could see."
	//210454 "The Romans would write of that day: 'In one city, the whole world perished.'"
	//
	//210501 "With Roman treachery repaid, Alaric looked to the future of our people. He planned to sail us to the fertile Roman province of Africa, but before we left, he passed from this world. Our people mourned for days and Alaric's body was buried underneath a river stream - the channel diverted to dig the grave, then made to flow again, hiding his tomb forever."
	//210502 "Soon after, the fleet that was to take us to Africa sank in a storm. Once again, desperation fell upon our people."
	//210503 "It was at that moment of despair that I, as the dead king's brother-in-law, spoke. I reminded everyone of Alaric's dream, of his commitment to the survival of our people, and of the impossible obstacles we had overcome. I told them that Alaric and I shared the same vision, a vision that we, in honor of his memory, ought to fulfill."
	//210504 "I concluded, 'Alaric has carved a path for us, and that path leads to Gaul!'"
	//210551 "Each night I have the same two visions."
	//210552 "One of a field of wheat stalks swaying in the wind. Another of bright burning flames, trampling horse hooves, and loud screams."
	//210553 "My people, the Visigoths, live peacefully in the rich lands of southern Gaul. Our farms flourish and our cattle grow in number every day. But for all our fortune, I cannot shake the ominous visions I have every night."
	//210554 "Like Alaric, I have seen the future."
	//210555 "The Hunner are coming and they will stop at nothing..."

	//// 11 - Dracula
	//
	//211101 "We could not make camp in the damp forest glade, so I led my companions along an old path towards the base of the mountain. It was overgrown with all manner of foliage, and the footing was difficult. Skydd and weapons littered the path, and stakes stood tall, covered with vines and moss."
	//211102 "Glancing around, I spotted a magnificent blade. Light yet firm and unblemished by the elements, it shone in the rain and lightning, a lone light in the darkening trail. The hilt was fashioned from steel, inlaid with silver and gold to form the figure of a defiant, wingless dragon."
	//211103 "As we reached the summit, I could not believe my eyes. A ruined yet imposing castle Vävstoled above us. Quietly rejoicing, my comrades moved towards their new camp. Then we heard the howls. Two massive wolves bounded out of the door of the castle towards my soldiers."
	//211104 "Fearing for their lives, they drew weapons, only to hear a voice from the shadows address the wolves--or the men--in a thick Wallachian accent. \"Stand down, fellows!\" Throwing large slabs of meat to the ravenous wolves, he calmed them and satiated their hunger."
	//211105 "Then he turned to us. \"Welcome to Poenari Castle, the ancient stronghold of the Draculesti.\" The mysterious man raised his hands in a gesture of welcome. \"It is well that your path has led you here. Come inside, sit by the fire, and feast while I tell you the tale of Vlad Dracula.\""
	//211151 "I stepped forth, holding out the mysterious sword and scabbard for our host to inspect. \"The Order of the Dragon,\" he said at once. \"What you have just brought me is the lost blade of Vlad Dracula himself!\""
	//211152 "I was shocked and immediately demanded an explanation. Our host's eyes flashed and there was a strained look on his face. Finally, the rush of memories seemed to slow and become more controlled. \"That is a long story...but then again, we have a long time until dawn.\""
	//211153 "\"Dracula sought refuge at the Moldavian court. There, he learned that Vladislav II had begun to mediate peace talks between the Ottomans and Hungarians, securing his position as Voivod of Wallachia. Furious, Dracula swore vengeance on Ottomans, Wallachian boyars, and Danesti clansmen alike.\""
	//
	//211201 "\"Dracula knew that he needed to enlist the aid of the Hungarians against Vladislav II, whose policies favored the Ottomans. He also remembered his education under the crusading Order of the Dragon, and wanted to honor his vows.\""
	//211202 "\"The Order was a powerful ally, and their crusader riddare would serve Dracula well against his enemies. As he paced the streets of the Moldavian capital, Dracula mused over his plan to reclaim his kingdom...\" As the mysterious old man paused, I rose up to take another slab of venison."
	//211203 "The old man stared into the fire, watching the flames dance as if they were soldiers involved in a raging battle. His eyes flashed again as a thought entered his mind, and he grasped the majestic old sword."
	//211204 "Meanwhile, Sultan Mehmed II had ascended to the Ottoman throne. Dracula loathed Mehmed from their time in Edirne, and he knew that the Turkar would be a thorn in his side for years to come. In 1453, they had conquered Constantinople, but they were presently occupied with campaigns in Greece and Serbia."
	//211205 "Bogdan II, Dracula's cousin and the new Voivod of Moldavia, had heard of his kinsman's plight and offered his help. If Dracula could cross the Carpathian Mountains into Transylvania and ally with Hungary, then they could launch a three-pronged assault on Vladislav II and the Turkar."
	//211251 "The elderly man gave a thin smile. \"Tenacity of mind can compensate for other disadvantages. As Dracula slaughtered untold numbers of enemy troops, the large circle of impaled men outside Targoviste grew to awe--and disgust--travelers for weeks to come.\""
	//211252 "\"Dracula owned Wallachia once more, but it was not the land his forebears ruled. Barren from endless wars, it was rife with corruption, crime, and poverty.\" Aghast, I asked my host how Dracula managed to reform a ruined shell of a country so quickly."
	//211253 "Grinning, the light flashed across the old man's eye again. \"Dracula despised dishonesty and crime, and sought to eliminate it. He knew that Wallachia had to become strong enough to face its enemies-and soon. And so his reforms began.\""
	//
	//211301 "\"The punishment for all offenses was death, for Dracula needed to make an example of criminals. Under his strong rule, trade was reopened and the economy blossomed. Proud of his achievement, Dracula placed a golden cup in the central square of Targoviste. The cup was never once touched throughout his reign.\""
	//211302 "I was shocked. The fear of the stake was surely enough to prevent crime, but to rule Wallachia while simultaneously evading the plots of the boyars was no small feat."
	//211303 "\"Dracula invited all of the boyars to a feast, and asked them how many rulers they had seen perish due to treachery. None had seen fewer than seven reigns, while some had even seen thirty! Furious, Dracula arrested them all and marched them here, to the former ruin of Poenari Castle!\""
	//211304 "\"For months they labored to rebuild the castle, toiling even after their clothes fell off! Those who survived were slain. Finally, Dracula had eradicated the fickle, conniving Bojarer. He replaced them with loyal followers, be they riddare or common peasants.\""
	//211305 "\"Strong again, the Dragon was ready to breathe a flame that would engulf his enemies, the Turkar.\""
	//211351 "This wise man, whomever he was, was certainly no commoner. I wondered aloud if perhaps he had fought in the wars of which he spoke."
	//211352 "My question was answered with a grin and a nod. I was awed - to encounter a soldier who had survived those years of turmoil and bloody warfare was rare."
	//211353 "\"We sacked Giurgiu, Darstor, Novoselo, Dridopoyrom, and many more towns,\" he muttered, revealing the scars on his arms. \"Our strikes were swifter than bolts of lightning. Yes, we have peace now, but I have never found it. Not a single day goes by when I do not think about it.\""
	//
	//211401 "\"Dracula never breathed a word of it, but many began to think that his time at the Ottoman court had stoked his hatred for his southern neighbor. For years, he had brooded over his brother Radu, who had treacherously pledged himself to the Turkar.\""
	//211402 "\"Dracula also had his vows to the Order of the Dragon to consider. The Pope and the Hungarian regent both desired war with the Turkar.\""
	//211403 "\"In the year 1462, Sultan Mehmed II renewed his efforts and sent a force of 18,000 into Wallachia. Thinking that Dracula would be unable to mobilize his army quickly enough, the Sultan sought to take Wallachia by storm with this small force. He was, of course, sadly mistaken.\""
	//211404 "I had heard whispers of the Danube butchering, but never a firsthand account. Dracula's enduring ability to overcome the most fearsome force of his time mesmerized me."
	//211405 "\"Dracula had a thirst for blood unlike any other, but he was fair. His sense of justice wrought a change in all of us. Dracula taught us to use our strengths to our advantage! Terror, speed, and surprise became weapons more potent than our blades...\""
	//211451 "\"Unfortunately, this was where my lord and I were separated. The Turkar entered the castle courtyard at Poenari with murder on their minds and ransacked the fortress that we had fought so hard to defend. Taking refuge in a secret tunnel, I watched Dracula's boat float downstream.\""
	//211452 "\"The stone bastions of Poenari never caught flame, so I was spared. As if God was with us, an avalanche struck the departing Turkish army and blocked the route to the castle.” Although this 'evidence' of divine retribution stirred our host, I figured that it was caused by the enemy cannon."
	//211453 "I was not eased by the change in the mood of our host. The calls of wolves and bats filled the air as we feasted. It seemed that the old man was lost in ruminations of times long gone by."
	//
	//211501 "Finally the ancient warrior resumed his tale. \"It was a long twelve years. I was alone, waiting here for signs of Dracula's return, but all I ever saw were Turkish marauders ravaging the countryside of this once beautiful land and tormenting the people.\""
	//211502 "\"One thing kept me from despair: the last words I had heard from my lord--that he would return in the end. I repeated these words to myself every day, and promised myself that he would succeed. It was a fool's hope, but it was the best that I had.\""
	//211503 "\"So I endured. Dracula had preserved enough food and water in the castle to last an entire army several years.\""
	//211504 "\"I had begun to think that he never would return, but rumor among the locals told me differently. When I overheard the same as I spied on Turkish patrols, I became more confident. I shuddered at the sight of the land that he would return to.\""
	//211505 "\"One day, I awoke to the thundering of hooves and the frenzied war cries of soldiers pouring down from the Carpathians. It was Dracula, at the head of a Hungarian army, come at last to liberate us from the yoke of the Turkar and their Wallachian puppet, Basarab Laiota...\""
	//211551 "\"Dracula achieved victory at last and the invaders fled before him. Rallying his men, he charged the enemy ranks with an unspeakable vengeance that emboldened his army. A decisive victory was near, but it was at that hour that Dracula's luck ran out.\""
	//211552 "\"A volley of arrows whistled through the air and struck Dracula in the chest, knocking him from his horse. The Turkar easily routed our leaderless forces and our chance to drive them out vanished. The occupation resumed and the survivors despaired.\""
	//211553 "The memory of a great man endures forever. As a token of gratitude, I invited our host to join us in a pilgrimage to the monastery at Snagov to pay our respects to Dracula's grave. Tears running down his face, the elderly man could do naught but nod in reply."

	//// 12 - Bari
	//
	//212101 "I left the walls drenched in the sweat and blood of the tenacious Norman besiegers. My comrades and I usually would rush straight to the inn after a fight-but not today. My father, the heroic Michael Nautikos, savior of Bari, awaited me."
	//212102 "I found the wizened old man staring out the window towards the enemy camp. \"Foul, treacherous mercenary scum! Son, the inhabitants of this peninsula have courted mercenaries for centuries. Not one bit of good it did them!\""
	//212103 "Weary of discussing Normans, whose nature I knew all too well, I inquired about our rich family heritage. I asked my father instead to tell me of our ancestor Panos."
	//212104 "My father spun around, his eyes gleaming. \"You wish to hear the story of the family? Our Greek blood runs back generations! Nautikos, our surname-it is so because we came as sailors.\""
	//212105 "\"In the year 869, the riddare Panos Nautikos answered the summons of his Byzantine liege, Emperor Basil II. He was to lead a force by sea to aid our ally Louis II, the Frankish king, against the Emirate of Bari.\""
	//212151 "\"Panos was offered lordship of Bari after his victory, but he declined, wishing to live out his days in peace. Having brought glory to his house, he settled down and started a family.\""
	//212152 "The old man mused for a while, his memory slowed by wine. \"Louis, on the other hand, ran into trouble with the Lombards. They were not fond of yet another Frankish conqueror treading on their soil.\""
	//212153 "Suddenly, a bell rang, signaling an attack and calling the city to arms. I donned my skydd and rushed out the door, leaving my father to his thoughts."
	//
	//212201 "I walked downstairs the next morning in a daze. The battle of the previous night was fresh in my mind, and it chilled my blood. I whirled around, and found myself staring straight into my father's eyes."
	//212202 "\"Nothing shakes the ghosts of battle like a fine story, son. Come, sit down to a meal, and I shall tell you of the rebellion of Melus!\""
	//212203 "The sun shone onto my father's gaunt face. He had a head of thick grey hair and his limbs remained strong from years as a sailor and a soldier."
	//212204 "\"I have donned mail since the year 1005, when I was but a lad in the service of Melus, the highest-ranking nobleman in the city. Ambitious and eager to prove myself, I soon became his best man.\""
	//212205 "\"Melus was passionate, but his withdrawn, stealthy manner began to stir my distrust. When he invited all manner of mercenary troops into our beautiful city, I began to fear the worst.\""
	//212251 "My father stood up to tend the fire. \"1011. It had been 2 years since I had stood in the courtyard of Melus' castle in Bari.\""
	//212252 "\"With the rebel garrison defeated, Bari was once again in Byzantine hands. Unsurprisingly, the local catepan, or lord, asked me to remain at the head of the force that I had recruited.\""
	//212253 "\"Most of Melus' family was captured and imprisoned, but Melus and his brother, Dattus, were still at large in the countryside. The rebellion was far from over.\""
	//
	//212301 "My father coughed and took another draught of wine. \"Melus sought aid from Salerno, while Dattus fortified a tower on the Garigliano River. From there, they gathered support  and renewed their strength.\""
	//212302 "\"Melus reached far for help. Lombards, Germans, and Apulians answered the call, eager for glory and plunder. But there was one more group whose help Melus enlisted!\""
	//212303 "\"A new generation of Norman adventurers, forebears of the scum who attack our city as we speak. It is because of Melus that this new menace is upon us.\""
	//212304 "\"In response, the Byzantine Emperor sent the general Basil Boioannes and an elite force of the fabled Varangian Guard to meet Melus in the field and crush the rebellion for good.\""
	//212305 "\"The armies drew up near the River Ofanto, not far from where the Romans had clashed with Hannibal of Carthage some twelve centuries earlier. The fate of the Mezzogiorno was about to be decided...\""
	//212351 "\"Not unlike its predecessor, the Second Battle of Cannae was a massacre. The Lombards and their Norman allies were no match for Boioannes' strategic prowess and the ferocity of his Varangian troops.\""
	//212352 "\"Melus fled the field and sought refuge with the Pope, which sent him to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor. He gradually poisoned the minds of several influential courtiers and, eventually, the Emperor himself.\""
	//212353 "\"Melus died in exile, but the effects of his political machinations were soon to be felt throughout Italy.\""
	//
	//212401 "\"The rebellion was over, but Boioannes still had a difficult task before him. The once-rich province of Apulia lay in tatters, and the hostility of its northern neighbors did not bode well for the future.\""
	//212402 "\"Melus' brother Dattus still preyed on the surrounding lands from his lair on the Garigliano. Additionally, rumor quickly spread of Holy Roman armies massing in the north.\""
	//212403 "\"Boioannes was not about to let his hard-earned gains slip away like a fish from the net. The odds were against him, but he had a loyal army and a plan.\""
	//212404 "\"The Apennine pass was the gateway to southern Italy, and Boioannes intended to fortify it. Thousands of soldiers and masons followed him to the ruins of Aecae, an ancient Roman city near the mountains, and began construction of a citadel named Troia.\""
	//212405 "\"Boioannes would restore the grandeur of Byzantine power in Italy, or die in the effort.\""
	//212451 "\"The Holy Roman Empire was no trifling opponent. Many good men fell parrying the assaults on Troia.\""
	//212452 "\"Boioannes' forces struck out at Dattus' tower on the Garigliano and dragged him from it. Following the ancient Roman custom, Dattus was confined in a leather sack with a rooster, a monkey, and a viper, and cast into the sea.\""
	//212453 "\"Byzantine Italy flourished under Boioannes' tenure as catepan. Alas that the incompetence of his successors have brought us to this dreadful pass...\""
	//
	//212501 "Young men seek renown on the battlefield, thinking war a noble affair. Little do they know that their quarries are in vain. There is nothing but chaos, the screams of dying men, and the stench of death."
	//212502 "I long for peace and cheer. I can hardly remember the sound of music in the streets and the noises of a bustling city on market day."
	//212503 "They have been replaced by the din of battle, the whistling of rocks hurled by Norman catapults, and the solemn evening tales in the taverns told by those who cannot forget the carnage of each day."
	//212504 "My father approached, holding a sword and his old helm, breastplate, faulds, and greaves. \"They are yours now. For 200 years, our family has proudly served this city, but today you must leave this place.\""
	//212505 "\"I am too old for the journey, but if you live, my death will not be in vain. Someday, you will tell your son this story with the same pride as I have. Fight well today, escape, and secure yourself that future.\""
	//212551 "The morning sun shone on the shores of the Aegean. I was speaking to a miller when I heard shouts from the harbor. Racing to the docks, I recognized several Barians disembarking from a battered vessel."
	//212552 "The tidings were grim: Bari was in Norman hands and my father had fallen valiantly along with it. I thought of his parting words, but I doubt that I will ever don his armaments again. Like my ancestor Panos, I have seen enough battle for ten lifetimes."
	//212553 "I think I shall travel the Empire from Thessaly to Anatolia, seeking work as I go. With all luck, I will earn enough wealth to buy a house in the countryside, and raise miles of vineyards on the hillside."
	//212554 "Perhaps, one day, when I recount the tale of my family to my children and grandchildren, I will be able to conclude it with how we have found peace at last."

	//
	//// 13 - Sforza
	//
	//213101 "So, you want to know about Sforza? I will tell you about Francesco Sforza."
	//213102 "Sforza was like me. We were condottieri - 'contract men.' When the Italian princes were too rich or too cowardly to get their hands dirty, they paid us."
	//213103 "We fought because they paid us to fight. We stole because they paid us to steal. And when they did not pay, we made sure someone did. We sold ourselves to the highest bidder, and if another prince came with a bigger purse, we did not hesitate to change sides. Honor was cheaper than silver, but for Sforza..."
	//213104 "Sforza was different. He was in it for his own glory."
	//213105 "That is why he took the Visconti contract. He wanted to make a name for himself - to be more than the bastard son of a dead mercenary. He needed a patron: an ambitious prince with many enemies and more gold than friends. Filippo Visconti, the Hertig of Milan, was the obvious choice."
	//213106 "Visconti had all the ambitions of Caesar, but none of the courage. He was craven and paranoid, but at least he paid - well, most of the time. And whether his ambitions meant war with Florence or with Venice, Visconti always needed contract men. That is why he hired condottieri like Sforza and Niccolo Piccinino - hungry men looking to make a name for themselves."
	//213151 "Visconti distrusted and hated us, but I do not blame him; his own brother was murdered by a condottiero on the steps of a church. Visconti saw Sforza's successes as a threat and plotted to have him killed."
	//213152 "But instead of running to safety, Sforza confronted the duke directly. To our surprise, Visconti was so impressed by this boldness that he dismissed the charges against Sforza and betrothed the soldier to his daughter Bianca. This made Sforza the duke's heir."
	//213153 "I will say this about Sforza: he was a scoundrel, but he was no coward. And his courage was always repaid."
	//
	//213201 "After the wars with Venice, Visconti made sure he got his gold's worth out of us. He sent Sforza south to enforce the duke's claims in Romagna. I think the duke was having second thoughts about Sforza - after we left, Piccinino and his men followed us."
	//213202 "Sforza could see through the plot. Although he was betrothed to the duke's daughter, he knew Visconti was fickle. He also knew that being a landless condottiero was a risky proposition. Sforza needed to be his own man and have his own land - a refuge if the machinations of his employers turned against him; or if they demanded justice for Sforza's own treachery."
	//213203 "What better opportunity than to use Visconti's weapons and money to his own benefit by making himself ruler of a city?"
	//213251 "Sforza and Piccinino were like two alley dogs fighting over a scrap of meat. They were natural rivals, precisely because they were so alike."
	//213252 "Of the two, Sforza had a certain pedigree; if you could call being the bastard of a mercenary captain 'pedigree.' From his father, Sforza inherited his furbizia -  cunning - and used it to get the best of his rivals, his patrons, and his women alike."
	//213253 "Piccinino, the son of a butcher, came into the profession as a soldier. He rose through the ranks and became an advisor to a trusting yet incompetent condottiero. In this position, Piccinino lured his captain into an ambush and took command of the company."
	//213254 "That Sforza and Piccinino would, years later, become blood enemies was as inevitable as two dogs fighting over a single piece of meat."
	//
	//213301 "If Sforza thought taking territory would make him safe, he was a fool. The King of Naples looked hungrily northward to the cities so easily taken by a rogue mercenary."
	//213302 "Sforza needed allies. Sigismondo Malatesta came with a Venetian force, as did Sforza's ever-loyal cousin Micheletto. But the condottiero needed a more powerful ally. He took his biggest gamble by going to meet an old friend."
	//213303 "You might have thought that when Sforza walked into the Milanese court that Visconti would have ordered him arrested - or that Piccinino would have personally killed him. But surprisingly, Visconti accepted Sforza like a father accepts his wayward son. Sforza and the duke's daughter were finally wed and the implication was obvious - Sforza would rule Milan when Visconti died."
	//213304 "Whatever the duke's intentions, this favoring of the prodigal son incensed Piccinino. He furiously tore his contract and stormed out of Milan."
	//213305 "If Visconti would not see Sforza for what he was, Piccinino would find another patron. Pledging himself to the King of Naples, Piccinino had one goal: to destroy Sforza."
	//213351 "The battle between Sforza and Piccinino was the centerpiece of the war over Italy. Sforza served Milan against Piccinino's Neapolitans, and then Piccinino returned to Milan's service while Sforza went to the Venetians. No matter which banners they fought under, the rivalry between the two men became the one constant of the war."
	//213352 "But Sforza's furbizia proved to be decisive. He defeated Piccinino in battles across northern and central Italy. The disgraced Piccinino was finally relieved by Visconti and spent his last breaths in Milan cursing Sforza's name to his two sons. With his rival and equal finally defeated, Sforza seemed destined to fulfill his grandest ambitions."
	//213353 "Then, by a twist of fate, Filippo Visconti died, undoing all of Sforza's plans."
	//
	//213401 "Visconti's death left Milan in turmoil. Outlying towns rebelled and Venice threatened the city."
	//213402 "By way of marriage, Sforza held a better claim on Milan than anyone, but strangely, the ambitious captain did not take his dowry. He allowed the lawyers and professors of Milan to fashion a republic with all the trappings and corruption of the old Roman one. They called it the Golden Ambrosian Republic after Saint Ambrose, but there was nothing blessed or saintly about this republic."
	//213403 "Surrounded by enemies, the Republicans of Milan - more skilled at reading books than leading men in war - needed a captain to command the war against Venice. Sforza, by now employed by the Venetians along with his compatriots Malatesta and Micheletto, did not miss an opportunity to once again betray those who paid him - as well as those closest to him."
	//213404 "Rescinding his own claims on Milan, he agreed to serve the Republic against his own cousin Micheletto in exchange for control of the city of Brescia. The leaders of the Republic agreed, even though there were many rumblings that Sforza could not be trusted. After all, for a piece of land he was now marching against his own blood."
	//213451 "Though Milan grew stronger with Sforza's victories, the Republicans came to fear and hate him. They saw Sforza as a Caesar intending to topple their new republic. These bookish professors and lawyers listened intently to two agitators who had returned to Milan - two brothers with harsh words and a fierce vendetta against Sforza."
	//213452 "The sons of none other than Piccinino swore vengeance upon Sforza. They incited the Republicans to betray him by signing a secret truce with Brescia before Sforza could take that city. This, of course, angered the condottiero. He had agreed to serve the Republic only in exchange for the city."
	//213453 "Stifling the ambitions of a man like Sforza was a fatal mistake..."
	//
	//213501 "Milan was prepared for the siege. Bronze cannons lined the walls and a vast militia was trained. Even the hoarding merchants sold their possessions to arm the mercenaries of the Piccinino brothers. Milan sent emissaries to convince the Hertig of Savoy that Sforza would threaten all of Italy. Thousands of Savoyard troops marched against Sforza."
	//213502 "But battles are not only won on the field with men and horses - they can also be won in a dark tent over a barrel of wine. In one such tent, Sforza met with Malatesta, now commander of the Venetian troops."
	//213503 "Malatesta listened as Sforza ranted furiously of Milan's treachery. He knew that Sforza was not angry that the Republic had betrayed him, as much as that it had done so before Sforza could betray the Republic."
	//213504 "But Sforza offered an opportunity for Malatesta and his Venetian employers. While Sforza hurled his men and his riches against Milan's walls, the Venetians would be free to conquer the rest of northern Italy. Malatesta agreed to help Sforza, but, as always, alliance and treachery between condottieri were only opposite sides of the same coin."

	//213552 "Is it better to be feared or loved? In that moment, Sforza was both."
	//213553 "Milan opened her gates and Sforza lavished the people with all of the grain - their own grain - that he had taken during the siege. The grateful, if foolish, people crowned Sforza - that treacherous, conniving, selfish bastard - Hertig of Milan. It was not his final triumph, but it was his grandest."
	//213554 "That is the story of Sforza from one who fought with him - and against him. Do I wish ill upon him? No more than I would wish ill on the fox who raids the henhouse in the black of night. It does only what a fox does and cannot be blamed for it. I do not blame Sforza any more than I would blame myself."

	//214101 "'So, you want to know why this region is called the Field of Blood?' The old man peered over in astonishment from his seat in the shadow of his stone hut. He smiled mischievously as he continued, 'You are probably not from here. If you were, you would not have asked such a question.'"
	//214102 "I nodded in affirmation, for the old man was right: I was a merchant from the south. 'It is the first time that my path has led to Cuzco, the heart of the Inca Empire', I explained."
	//214103 "'You are fortunate that you have chosen to rest in my village, my young and illiterate friend,' the old man told me, rising and pointing to the entrance of his dwelling."
	//214104 "You must know that I am the most renowned storyteller in the entire valley. If there is anyone in the world who can explain why the plain that surrounds us has that ominous name, it is I,' he said, gesturing to me to enter his house."
	//214105 "'Today, all inhabitants of this region are full of admiration for our empire,' he boasted, 'but everything that is now subject to the Inca had to be conquered. Who knows? If not for Viracocha Inca, we all might still be simple farmers like I am.'"
	//214106 "'During the years before his reign, many nearby tribes were periodically conquered, but no garrisons or Inca officials were placed among them. This pattern of raiding and plundering changed during the reign of Viracocha. He would establish permanent rule over the neighboring tribes.'"
	//214151 "'Viracocha was convinced that he was favored by the gods,' the old man continued in a tone that suddenly seemed scornful, 'but in truth he owed his victories to his two generals: Vicaquirao and Apo Mayta. They were the strategists behind the military tactics that made the conquest of the Cuzco valley possible in the first place.'"
	//214152 "'Viracocha was too conceited to realize that, and his pride following their hard-fought triumph nearly led the Inca to ruin.'"
	//
	//214201 "When the old man had begun his story, the hut had been flooded by sunlight. The golden disk had long since sunk below the horizon, and the light of the embers dancing around in the darkness only faintly illuminated his wrinkled face. He refilled his clay mug and then continued the story."
	//214202 "'Viracocha believed that his reign was sacred and that he was protected by divine providence. However, the gods had turned away from him towards a new favorite: a wild, young warlord named Anccu Hualloc. He hailed from the Chanca tribes and had recruited more than 40,000 warriors, with whom he marched on Cuzco!'"
	//214203 "'The inhabitants were sure that their beloved ruler would remain strong and drive out the invaders. Sadly, Viracocha had grown old and fear had infected his heart. Together with Urqu, his favorite son, he fled, abandoning his people to their fate.'"
	//214204 "'Not all of Viracocha's sons were as cowardly as their father. Cusi Yupanqui refused to follow his aged father, and instead took command of the defense. Full of confidence, he announced that he would defeat the Chanca army. However, the few soldiers remaining in the city could not be impressed by bold words, as Cusi Yupanqui had no military experience to justify his claim. Luckily, Vicaquirao and Apo Mayta had also remained in Cuzco...'"
	//214251 "I was captivated by the words of the old man. When he had finished, I exclaimed: 'So, that is why this area is called Yawarpampa, the Field of Blood!' His eyes sparkled."
	//214252 "'Yes, the ground on which my hut stands today was watered by the blood of the Chanca. Cusi Yupanqui, with the help of his generals, had accomplished the impossible: Cuzco had been saved from an overwhelmingly superior force.'"
	//214253 "'The name of Cusi Yupanqui soon fell into oblivion, but only because the people that he had saved from the Chanca invasion began to call their savior Pachakutiq Inca Yupanqui, 'he who overturns space and time.' Now, there were also those who wished immediately to rid themselves of the victorious hero. His own family, driven by jealousy, began to conspire against him.'"
	//
	//214301 "The moon had risen, but sleep was far from my mind. I hung on the words of the old man, who did not seem the least bit tired. It was as if the more he talked about Pachakutiq, the livelier he became."
	//214302 "'I told you about the great battle of Cuzco,' he continued, 'but you must know that this glorious victory did not bring peace to the Inca. On the contrary, a civil war broke out, for the success of his son filled Pachakutiq's father with envy.'"
	//214303 "Viracocha still wished for his son Urqu to become king of the Inca, although everyone could see that Pachakutiq was far more capable. After all, it was he who defended Cuzco, the holy city, while Urqu had fled into the mountains along with Viracocha."
	//214304 "Although Viracocha had grown old and died a bitter man shortly thereafter, Urqu did not intend to yield. He entrenched himself in Calas, a mountain fortress, and proclaimed himself Sapa Inca, supreme ruler."
	//214305 "Of course, the thought of coming to terms with his treacherous brother did not once cross Pachakutiq's mind. Gathering his warriors, he led them to Calas to eliminate Urqu once and for all."
	//214351 "The old man sneered as he described the end of Urqu, who was slain in battle. 'For the Inca, the end of Urqu was a blessing,' he told me, 'for it left Pachakutiq the undisputed ruler, and it showed that he was not only a valiant warlord but also a prudent king.'"
	//214352 "'Having refurnished the Temple of the Sun, he turned to rebuilding the entire city of Cuzco. He also built fortresses, palaces, roads and temples throughout the country. In addition, he issued wise decrees beyond count and led his kingdom into a golden age.'"
	//214353 "'I still believe that the people were right to hail Pachakutiq as 'Son of the Sun,' for he had once again led the Inka out of the darkness.'"
	//
	//214401 "The stories of Pachakutiq and his followers fascinated me, so it filled me with joy when my host laid down his mug and continued. Clearly, his story was far from over. 'Pachakutiq knew that the Inca would never live in peace if their greatest rivals, the Chanca, remained powerful. In any case, he had a score to settle with Anccu Hualloc, who had nearly succeeded in conquering Cuzco.'"
	//214402 "Pachakutiq sent his troops north to occupy Waman Karpa, 'the Falcon's Tent,' capital of the Chanca. Once again, he tasked Vicaquirao and Apo Mayta, who remained at his side during the civil war, with the command of the army. Fueled by panic, the Chanca began to organize their defense, for it was now their turn to be hunted. The winds had shifted.'"
	//214451 "'At that time, it was common for Chanca warriors to intimidate their enemies by using cups fashioned from the skulls of prisoners to drink the blood of the slain. Even so, when the victorious Inca troops entered Waman Karpa, the remaining defenders had no choice but to surrender.'"
	//214452 "'Everyone thought that Pachakutiq would take bloody revenge on the Chanca,' the old man explained, 'but Pachakutiq instead chose mercy and integrated the surviving warriors of the Chanca into his army. Astonishingly enough, they became loyal followers and acknowledged the Inca king as their new overlord.'"
	//214453 "'The domain of the Inca was now greater than ever. Pachakutiq's superiority had become too overwhelming and his armies too effective, leaving no tribes who could contend with the Inca - except for the Kingdom of Chimor, which was located near the coast to the west.'"
	//
	//214501 "'You are still quite young, my friend,' the old man observed, smiling amicably, 'but look at me. At some point your hair will turn gray just like mine, and your hands will become wrinkled as well. A king will also grow old one day, even if he is the 'Son of the Sun'.'"
	//214502 "Pachakutiq knew that he needed a capable successor to sustain the state that he had built. There was only one man who could be considered: his own son, Topa Yupanqui.'"
	//214503 "Topa Yupanqui seemed to have inherited his father's military skills. He already bore the title 'Apukispay,' leader of the imperial troops. To test his mettle, Pachakutiq gave his son the command of the campaign against the Chimor Empire.'"
	//214504 "The Chimú were not to be underestimated. On the coast, they had built a magnificent city called Chan-Chan, whose splendor rivaled that of Cuzco itself. Massive canal systems fed the city with fresh water, and magnificent pyramids adorned the city. Chimor was quite wealthy due to the droves of slaves harvesting gold from the abundant sources nearby. The discipline of its military was the stuff of legend.'"
	//214505 "The people of Cuzco anxiously awaited the outcome of the campaign against the remote coastal kingdom. Would Topa Yupanqui succeed in completing the work of his father and bring the expansion of the Inca to a dignified conclusion?'"
	//214551 "The old man was silent for some time, but then addressed me: 'You have surely heard of the Tawantinsuyu, the realm of the four parts? That is what we call our empire, since Topa Yupanqui succeeded in subjugating the Chimú.'"
	//214552 "The lands to the north, south, east and west had finally been conquered, and the Inca now dominated the entire region--mountain and valley.'"
	//214553 "Knowing that his son was of equal wisdom and virtue, Pachakutiq could die without regret. Now you know the entire story - the story of the Inca.'"
	//214554 "I hesitated for a moment before asking the old man: 'You have told me much indeed, but what was the fate of the two generals, Vicaquirao and Apo Mayta? Surely their story does not end there!'"
	//214555 "The old man beamed at me and laughed before giving his answer. 'Well, Vicaquirao gave his life in battle and died the most honorable death imaginable."
	//214556 "Apo Mayta was not quite as favored by fortune, however. It is said that, having grown older than the hills themselves, he now lives a life of solitude in a stone hut. From time to time, you might find him telling inquisitive travelers tales of bygone times that are so fantastic that they seem almost difficult to believe.'"

	//// 15 - Prithviraj
	//
	//215101 "Long ago, a great and wise sage climbed the holy peak of Mount Abu. He sought the favor of the gods to protect the people of the earth, but he was descended upon by Rakshasas, man-eating demons with flame-red eyes and fangs like steel."
	//215102 "But though the demons neared, the sage was as immovable as the mountain itself. Though he felt the heat of the demons' breath on his bare shoulder, the sage was resolute - making the offering of fire to the gods and asking for their protection."
	//215103 "From the flames of his offering spawned the Rajput clans, born of fire and smoke. Their heroes fought the Rakshasas, but though much blood was shed, the demon menace continued to darken Mount Abu."
	//215104 "The sage dug a new fire pit, deeper into the mountain earth, and again made the offering. From this pit came Chauhan, weapons in his four arms. He slew the Rakshasas and from his loins came the mightiest of the Rajput clans. From this clan came my king."
	//215105 "I am Chand Bardai, poet of the raja's court. I will tell you the story of a great king, but this story, much like life itself, must start from the beginning. My king, Prithviraj, was not always a great raja. Once, he was a young king of Ajmer challenged by his own cousin for rule of the Chauhan clan."
	//215151 "In those days, the Rajput clans raided and warred with one another. They were Kshatriya - warriors from birth. A young Rajput like Prithviraj was headstrong and brave - but to be a wise king would take more than courage."
	//215152 "From his minister Kaimbasa, Prithviraj learned wisdom and how to rule. But the spirit of the Kshatriya would never leave him; my raja longed for new victories and lands to conquer."
	//
	//215201 "Rajasthan is a harsh land: a desolate desert snaked by the winding fingers of the Ganga River. The Rajput clans who rule here are as tough as the desert soil and as passionate and unpredictable as the river's flows. The name Rajasthan means 'the land of the kings,' and from this land come India's greatest warriors and rajas."
	//215202 "A king named Jayachandra ruled the strongest of the clans. His experience and might was surpassed only by his bitter anger and ambition. He sought to rule all of Rajasthan."
	//215203 "In keeping with the ancient traditions, Jayachandra ordered a ritual signifying his authority. A mare was released into Rajasthan and pursued by the king's warriors. Wherever the horse went, the ruler of that land would either accept Jayachandra's authority or challenge it by fighting the warriors."
	//215204 "As Prithviraj hunted tigers in the forest, he discovered how quickly the hunter could himself become the hunted."
	//215251 "All of India heard tales of Prithviraj's digvijaya - his conquest of all directions. The Rajput princes submitted to him and word of his victories spread far. Princes came from all lands to congratulate the young raja."
	//215252 "But far greater than any princely gift was the love of a princess. In Kannauj, in the very court of his rival Jayachandra, Prithviraj caught the eye of Sanyogita, a headstrong Rajput princess with bewitching beauty. The young king fell in love with Jayachandra's own daughter."
	//
	//215301 "My king was in love with Sanyogita. The two would sneak away from their courts to meet in border towns and wooded groves, where they would embrace under the bright light of the moon."
	//215302 "But for all their secrecy, their romance could not be hidden from the powerful Jayachandra and his army of spies."
	//215303 "The mighty king would never approve of his daughter marrying his own rival. Instead, he ordered a swayamvara - a ceremony where Sanyogita would choose her husband from the men invited by her father. Jayachandra invited all the princes and kings of India to the ceremony, except for one."
	//215304 "Almost one. In mockery of Prithviraj, Jayachandra had a clay statue made in the young king's image to serve as the doorman to his court."
	//215351 "Sanyogita was as headstrong as she was beautiful. With the infinite courage of a Rajput princess, she walked through the royal court carrying the ceremonial garland and ignoring the expectant gazes of her suitors. Coming to the door, she defiantly laid the garland around the neck of the clay statue of Prithviraj, declaring him her husband."
	//215352 "To her surprise, the young raja had braved the dangers of his rival's kingdom to slip into the ceremony. Emerging from behind the statue, Prithviraj embraced Sanyogita. The two rode to Ajmer as the furious Jayachandra vowed that his revenge would be felt to the ends of the earth."
	//
	//215401 "Without his daughter, Jayachandra became a stampeding elephant - no one was safe from his overflowing rage. But anger alone could not win a war and Jayachandra would not have been a threat to my raja had it not been for the jealousy and cunning of a once loyal subject."
	//215402 "Oh Kaimbasa! How love and jealously made him betray his master! The minister who had advised my king since he was a boy, and whom Prithviraj honored like a beloved uncle, sought the one woman he could not have - Kaimbasa fell in love with Sanyogita. His jealousy drove him to Jayachandra's court to betray his own king."
	//215403 "Whispering in Jayachandra's ear, Kaimbasa gave direction and purpose to the king's anger."
	//215404 "He urged Jayachandra to send an ambassador to the Afghan hills to find Muhammad Ghori, a brutal warlord said to command a slave army numbering in the thousands. The messenger would regale the Turk with tales of the riches of Prithviraj's kingdom and whisper to him how the young king was too smitten with his bride to defend his lands."
	//215405 "Then, Kaimbasa promised the vengeful king, Prithviraj would be defeated and Jayachandra would rule Rajasthan."
	//215406 "Unknown to the two men, their fateful scheme would jeopardize all of India."
	//215451 "Thousands of Turkish horsemen - the slave soldiers of a savage warlord - descended from the Afghan hills to the plain at Tarain. Great clouds of dust rose in their wake, obstructing the vision of the Rajput Kshatriya. The Turkish kavalleri unleashed a shower of arrows on the Rajputs. The Indian warriors, facing an enemy they could not see, could only weather the blows against them."
	//215452 "With the battle hanging in the balance, Govind Tai, brother of my king, rode alone into the dusty fray, challenging the Turkish warlord to single combat. He struck Muhammad Ghori from his horse and wounded him. The warlord's slaves encircled their master and carried him off the field as the Turkish trumpets bleated a retreat."
	//
	//215501 "Prithviraj's victory over Muhammad Ghori proved to be a curse. Believing that the Turk would not return, my raja took to revelry and the company of Sanyogita, leaving the defenses to rot."
	//215502 "It is here that I, Chand Bardai, enter the story and make my mark on my king's legend. I warned my raja that nothing would stop the Turk. The warlord had come down from the barren Afghan mountains to gaze upon the wealth of India and would return with a larger army."
	//215503 "My raja was wise and he listened to me. He sent messengers to the other Rajput princes, calling them to war. But few listened."
	//215504 "Laughing, the princes told the messengers that surely the Turkar would not return so soon after being bloodied by Rajput Kshatriya. The princes of Rajasthan sent only token forces to aid my raja's defense."
	//215505 "As my king marched once again to war, I feared that he would not return. I began to write this tale and shared it with the other poets. Even if my king did not survive the battle, his legend would live on throughout all of India."
	//215506 "I would make sure of it.   "
	//215551 "Prithviraj's heroism could not overcome his delay. He was defeated and taken to the Turkish warlord's castle in the Afghan mountains. There, my king was cruelly blinded and imprisoned."
	//215552 "I followed my raja in his captivity. When I came to the Turkish court, I regaled the warlord with the same tales and feats that I have told you. Surely, I persuaded him, a generous warlord would treat such a heroic raja as a companion and vassal, not as a prisoner condemned to a sullen dungeon."
	//215553 "But Muhammad's heart was cruel and though he brought my raja from his prison, he mocked Prithviraj for his blindness. In ridicule, he threw a bow and a single arrow at my raja's feet and dared him to strike at him."
	//215554 "Prithviraj drew the bow. Though he could not see, the sound of the Turk's sneering laughter made his aim true. He released the arrow, striking Muhammad Ghori. The guards fell upon Prithviraj and slew him."
	//215555 "In Ajmer, Sanyogita was stricken with grief. So strong was her love that she could not bear to live another day without her Prithviraj. In honor of her husband, and defiant to the end, she took her life by throwing herself into a fire."
	//215556 "Thus, my story ends where it began - with a legend born of fire."

	//216101 "Seventy-three long years have passed since thousands of nomadic riders flooded the Eastern borders of Persia, defeated the Persian army, and killed the shah himself. The invaders plunged deep into the heartland of the empire. The weakened Perser had no choice but to give in to the outrageous demands of tribute imposed by the White Hunner."
	//216102 "Now, Khosrau, the grandson of the slain shah, is ready to take revenge for the eternal shame cast upon his empire."
	//216103 "Persian heralds visit the four corners of the empire to gather one of the largest armies this world has ever seen. But even with an army that could fill the space between the Zagros and the Alborz mountain ranges, the White Hunnic horse skyttar will not be easily beaten."
	//216104 "Khosrau knows that perhaps the only way to ensure victory is to ally with another nomadic people: the Gokturks. These Nomader from lands hardly touched by civilization hate the White Hunner as much as the Perser do. They are as tough and hardy as the White Hunner, and, most importantly, can strike the Hunner from their rear."
	//216105 "The earth trembles as thousands of Persian horses and elephants travel to battle. Khosrau will soon show the world that the Persian Empire is still a force to be reckoned with..."
	//216151 "The White Hunner were powerful but too disorganized to cope with multiple invasions. When the Perser and their Turkic allies launched a two-pronged attack, the White Hunner panicked. The mighty Persian beasts of war and swift, accurate Turkish horse skyttar crushed the disorientated enemy within eight days."
	//216152 "After the Persian victory at Bukhara, the White Hunner faded into history and the Gokturks and Perser divided the conquered land among themselves. Under Khosrau, Persia once more became a worthy rival of the Byzantine Empire, while the Turkar established themselves in the vacuum left by the White Hunner."

Three of Europe's most renowned rulers have sworn to fight: Fredrik Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire, Philip Augustus of France, and Rikard Lejonhjärta, King of England."
	//216202 "While the Emperor Barbarossa marches his army across Europe, the kings of France and England sail to the Holy Land. Richard's journey, however, is as adventurous as one can expect of someone known as the 'Lionheart.'"
	//216203 "A Mediterranean storm scatters the English fleet and shipwrecks many of Richard's ships on the island of Cyprus. The island's ruler and rebellious Byzantine lord, Isaac Komnenos, has taken the stranded English prisoner. Among the captured is Richard's very own sister."
	//216204 "Richard is determined to punish Komnenos for this insult, but he also sees opportunity in these unfortunate events. Cyprus is an island of great strategic value. If the English can capture it, Cyprus could be used as a naval base for korståget and raids on the wealthy Muslim trade ships."
	//216251 "Richard's combined naval and land operations proved to be successful and Cyprus was swiftly taken by the Korsfarare. Isaac was thrown into the dungeons and Richard crowned himself king of the island. Richard then sailed east to resume his korståg."
	//216252 "Upon his arrival in the Holy Land, however, Richard discovered that he alone remained to lead the Korståg. Barbarossa had drowned crossing an Anatolian river, and Philip Augustus had returned to France with an illness. Despite these setbacks, Richard proved more than capable of the task ahead, matching wits with the famed Saladin."

	//216601 "In the distance, wooden torn as tall as giants take shape in the dense morning fog that hovers over the vast Poyang lake. These wooden islands, each carrying two to three thousand men and horses, are tall enough to scale city walls. Their target is the Ming city of Nanchang."
	//216602 "The Mongol Yuan dynasty is on the verge of collapse and Kineser warlords are eager to take its place. The Han want to make use of the fighting between their rivals, the Ming and the Wu, to launch a surprise attack on the Ming and seize the Jiangxi region from them."
	//216603 "The Ming, however, are not prepared to surrender Nanchang so easily, and their army sails north to face the Han. The Ming general Zhu Yuanzhang is outnumbered, but he is determined to thwart the Han ambitions. After all, only one warlord can rule China."
	//216651 "Although vastly outnumbered by the large Han tower ships, the smaller and more maneuverable Ming vessels were better suited for the shallow water. During the second night of the battle, the Ming launched a surprise attack with fire ships, which devastated many of the Han ships. Thousands of Han soldiers drowned or burned alive."
	//216652 "The Ming victory secured their position as the strongest faction in China. In time, they conquered the Middle Kingdom, ending a century of Mongol domination. The new dynasty ruled China for nearly three centuries, ushering in a great age of prosperity and stability."

	//// 16-7 - Sogut
	//
	//216701 "As the Mongoler descend on the Near East, the Turkish sultanate of Rum is on its last legs and will likely soon crumble. Several Turkish chiefs in Anatolia, called beys, are ready to seize the sultan's lands. Their warriors are hardy and fierce, untamed by the niceties of the Rum court. Once the sultanate is theirs, nothing will stop their further expansion west into Byzantine lands."
	//216702 "The most fierce of the Turkish beys is Osman “the Bone Breaker,” a reputable man who claims to have been given the authority to rule over the world by God himself. He is determined to unite the Turkar against their common enemies."
	//216703 "Facing Osman is the proclaimed savior of the Byzantine Empire: Roger de Flor, a former Riddare Templar and commander of the Catalan Company of mercenaries. Years of service fighting for the lords and princes of Europe have made him and his soldiers hardened veterans."
	//216704 "The future of Europe and the Middle East will be decided by the outcome of the battle between these two great men."
	//216751 "Roger de Flor proved to be a match for Osman. He managed to defeat Turkish armies on several occasions and almost drove them out of Anatolia."
	//216752 "Just as de Flor neared his greatest victory, he was betrayed. The jealous Byzantine nobles, fearing that de Flor would take the reconquered lands for himself, ordered his assassination. In retaliation, de Flor's Catalan Company ravaged Byzantine Anatolia and Greece before returning home with the body of their esteemed commander."
	//216753 "With de Flor finally gone, Osman could complete his conquests and consolidate his power. The other Turkish beys soon acknowledged his rule and he founded his own empire that would bear his name: Osmanli Devleti... the Ottoman Empire."

	//216801 "Shouts of assent ring around the hall as the sons of Ragnar finish speaking, and ravens fly upwards, eager to bring good tidings to the Aesir. Moments later, the sky flashes with lightning and booms with thunder, signaling the approval of the gods."
	//216802 "Days later, the mustering begins. Kings, jarls, warriors, and common folk alike gather, eager to seek vengeance on the Northumbrian king Aella for the dishonorable slaying of Ragnar. Ivar, one of Ragnar's sons, has sworn to carve the blood eagle on Aella in retribution."
	//216803 "It is a sight to behold. Hundreds of longships bear crews of valiant Norsemen and enough supplies to last the army months. The Valkyries look on, for they will soon swell Odin's hall with brave warriors who fall in the coming battles."
	//216804 "Ragnar's sons approach a small band of warriors with a dangerous but important quest: to scout ish Isles and establish a camp. When the army arrives, it will need a secure base from which to strike out against the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that dominate the British mainland."
	//216805 "Thor is pleased, for the seas are benign and the winds favorable, allowing the longships a serene passage across the North Sea. As they near York, the seat of Northumbria, the sound of the sea mingles with the grinding of axes. Skalds eagerly prepare to craft the verses for a saga that will be passed down until the end of time."
	//216851 "Favored by Odin and Thor, the Vikingar watered the ground with the blood of their enemies, seizing vast amounts of plunder and fertile land. The stench of smoke and death filled the air as hapless victims foolishly turned to their altars instead of their swords."
	//216852 "The haughty Anglo-Saxons met their match at the hands of ruthless Viking warriors eager to earn their place at Odin's table. True to their word, Ragnar's sons carved the blood eagle into the back of the cowardly Aella as a warning to any who might think of opposing them."
	//216853 "Ragnar's sons settled the land that they had conquered, eventually establishing a state known as the Danelaw. For the next two centuries, Dane and Saxon would live as neighbors, sometimes at war, sometimes in peace, until the Saxon victory over the Norse at Stamford Bridge in 1066 foiled the last Viking invasion of England."

	//217102 "I begin my tale as the winds throw the sands up into a spiral, forcing the men and horses to shield their eyes and seek refuge. I cannot help but notice how the camels stand tall, undaunted."
	//217103 "We are a people of the horse, but we have the resilience of camels as well. Invaders have swept through this land for centuries, and yet we Berber have remained powerful and strong-willed."
	//217104 "Despite our strength, we have only rarely ventured outside of our homeland on the path of conquest. That is about to change. A man named Tariq ibn Ziyad has sowed the seeds of ambition among warriors and simple herdsmen alike, and we prepare for war."
	//217105 "Tariq is not as other men. Once a slave, he rose to become a brilliant general. Strong, charismatic, and tactful, he is also a Berber like us. Thousands of men flock to his banner, and men who formerly shunned the thought of venturing across the sea now eagerly board the ships destined for Iberia."
	//217106 "With Allah as my witness, I shall truthfully record the events to come, for good or ill."
	//217151 "Wracked by fear and treachery, the slow Visigoth forces fell easily to our agile horsemen. Thousands lie dead, and yet one cannot help but admire how the Visigoths fought valiantly and honorably to the bitter end. It is a melancholy thing to see their corpses left to the crows and wolves."
	//217152 "As we entered the city of Cordoba, our men stared in awe at the Arkitektur and riches on display. Now is no time for resting, Tariq tells us. There is much left to be done."
	//
	//217201 "712 AD, year 90 of the Hegira..."
	//217202 "Banners billow in the wind and the tips of spears glisten in the sun as hundreds of soldiers ride by. A horn sounds as the front of the column approaches a promontory overlooking a large, glorious city."
	//217203 "We have reached Toledo, the center of the Visigoth Kingdom. I can hardly believe my eyes at her beauty... a city worthy of a king. Tariq is determined that we capture Toledo quickly, before the neighboring cities have the chance to react."
	//217204 "The Visigoth heartland will be difficult to subdue. Opposing us, in addition to Toledo, are the cities of Seville, Merida, Talavera, and Guadalajara. Many of these cities date back to a time when the Romans still ruled these lands."
	//217205 "We are not alone, however. Tariq's former master, Musa ibn Nusayr, has landed in the south with a large army. If we can capture Toledo and hold it until Musa's soldiers arrive, we will crush the Visigoths with a two-pronged attack!"
	//217251 "The Visigoth cities did not fall easily. These people truly fight like lions!"
	//217252 "To breach the walls of Toledo, Tariq ordered the construction of two large rustninged rams with iron heads. These engines are indeed fearsome to behold... the gates of city after city crumbled before their might."
	//217253 "A cloud of dust could be seen from miles away as Musa's army approached, laden down with the spoils of war after having breached the cities of Seville and Merida. Both armies celebrated their success with much revelry."
	//
	//217301 "713 AD, year 91 of the Hegira..."
	//217302 "The meeting between Tariq and Musa was sträckvidd to witness. The respect between the two is considerable, but there is an air of competition, of rivalry..."
	//217303 "The Caliph has ordered that Tariq and Musa return to Damascus, but they refuse to be robbed of their glory. Dividing the army, Tariq strikes north, while Musa targets the city of Zaragoza."
	//217304 "Recognizing our might, a local Visigoth lord, Theodemir of Murcia, has pledged us his support. Home to a strong army and a thriving economy, Murcia will be a potent ally."
	//217305 "However, we have a new and dangerous enemy. Pelayo of Asturias, a Visigoth nobleman, has rallied what was a fractured resistance into a formidable adversary. In his dominion in Asturias, a large army gathers, preparing to attack."
	//217306 "If we can weather the storm that is sure to come, with the blessing of Allah we may even be able to conquer as far as Septimania!"
	//217351 "Septimania and the Ebro valley have fallen beneath the heel of our glorious armies, but we have not achieved a complete victory. Tariq and Musa were forced to return to Damascus, and without their leadership it will be difficult to defeat the Asturians."
	//217352 "The future of the conquest looks bleak. I shall continue to chronicle the events ahead, though I fear that our land may fall victim to invasions and internal strife, like so many other kingdoms before us."
	//
	//217401 "732 AD, year 110 of the Hegira..."
	//217402 "After many years, our people have finally found another glorious leader to follow. Seeking vengeance for the defeat of our armies at the hands of the Franker over ten years before, Abd ar-Rahman al-Ghafiqi has rallied our armies for another campaign."
	//217403 "Bred on the battlefield, al-Ghafiqi is no stranger to the ways of war. In addition to successful forays against the Visigoths, Asturians, and Franker, his most recent exploit was the quelling of a rebellion by the Berber governor in Catalonia."
	//217404 "To reach the land of the Franker, we must make a dangerous crossing of the Pyrenees. To arrive at the other side in time for spring, we will be forced to start this journey in the dead of winter."
	//217405 "The rugged terrain is difficult for armies to cross, and our enemies will surely seek to hinder our passage. Many men will not survive the journey."
	//217406 "I grow old, but I will make this journey through the frigid mountains so that I might see another year of conquest."
	//217451 "Truly, I have not endured such a trying journey in the entirety of my life. The cold and cruel winds were like nothing I have ever experienced, and the fear of enemy ambushes lurking behind every bend is enough to drive a man mad."
	//217452 "Between the elements and enemy blades, many of our men perished on the crossing. Nevertheless, we arrived in considerable force on the other side. It is more than many hoped for."
	//217453 "We have little time to rest and recover our strength. The Franker will not lie waiting forever."
	//
	//217501 "732 AD, year 110 of the Hegira. A month since we crossed the Pyrenees..."
	//217502 "Our army advances into the heart of Aquitania, scouting the region as we move forward. Thick forests and open fields abound, and we made camp near a river crossing."
	//217503 "The Frankish army is powerful, but their kavalleri cannot match ours as long as we fight on an open field. Using our mobility to our advantage will prove vital in the battles ahead."
	//217504 "Al-Ghafiqi will risk no error. He has a score to settle with the Frankish count Odo of Aquitaine, the warlord who smashed an Umayyad army at Toulouse ten years ago. After such a long time, these two giants will finally meet again."
	//217505 "The Frankish lands are divided and are no match for the organization of the Umayyad Caliphate. Capturing the city of Bordeaux will surely throw the region into chaos. Then, we will pounce on the scattered Frankish army like a cat upon a mouse."
	//217506 "This will be the great razzia, or raid, of our time. I can only pray that we are up to the challenge."
	//217551 "With the blessing of Allah, the horn announcing our success sings a loud, shrill tone that echoes over the countryside. Upon hearing of our approach, Odo's army descended upon Bordeaux, only to be trampled beneath our hooves."
	//217552 "Another Frankish army hastened south but was no match for our brave, seasoned warriors. A bloody battle ensued, and afterwards the Franker lamented their defeat, saying that God alone knows the number of the slain."
	//217553 "With the Frankish army defeated, there is little standing between our magnificent forces and eternal glory as the conquerors of Europe. For centuries, history will remember us as the courageous warriors who defeated countless kings."
	//217554 "My journey is at an end, but our triumphant army marches north to defeat one final adversary. A man who calls himself \"The Hammer\"--Martel in the Frankish tongue--foolishly believes that he can resist us."
	//217555 "Soon enough, his feeble army will crumble and flee just like the rest."

	//// 18 - Sundjata
	//
	//218101 "You ask me if I know the epic of Sundjata, the great founder of the Mali Empire? Ha ha! You were right not to seek out any ordinary storyteller. For I am Kouyaté, griot of the royal family. Listen well, and I will tell you of this man, Sundjata."
	//218102 "Sundjata was born to the second wife of the king of the Mandinka people. For the first several years of his life, he could not stand upright. A blacksmith made a sturdy iron rod so that the boy might prop himself up on it, but even that broke beneath him. Then Sundjata found a branch from the sacred baobab tree and miraculously he took his first steps."
	//218103 "The king's first wife seethed with jealousy, however. She saw no reason for this feeble son of a second wife to take the throne over her own son. When the king died, she exiled Sundjata and his mother."
	//218104 "They fled to faraway lands, but each kingdom feared the wrath of the Mandinkas and would not take them."
	//218105 "Only the Mema, far to the south, did not fear the Mandinka. They are a people of proud warriors, and among them Sundjata learned how to hunt and fight. He left his disability behind and became as fierce and strong as a lion! Before long, he was ready to take back his rightful place on the throne."
	//218106 "When he arrived, however, he found the Mandinka capital in flames ..."
	//218151 "Sosso warriors from the far north had overrun the capital on the river, slaughtered the new king and all of the royal family, and claimed the land of the Mandinkas for their lord, Sumanguru!"
	//218152 "Sundjata barely escaped the raiding parties ravaging his homeland. As the only survivor with a claim to the Mandinka throne, Sundjata would never truly be safe. "
	//218153 "Sundjata knew that he had to bide his time and hide from the Sosso spies until he was strong enough to strike back!"
	//
	//218201 "Sumanguru was a cruel tyrant and a sorcerer in command of powerful spirits. He was said to possess a magical balophon which would grant him victory if he played it."
	//218202 "Whether or not Sumanguru had magical powers, he was above all an ambitious conqueror seeking to seize the lands of the old empire of Ghana, a golden kingdom of great wealth and sophistication lost to the desert."
	//218203 "Sundjata knew that contesting such a man would be difficult. The Sosso had allied with other tribes in the north: the Jolof, the Diafanu, and others who profited immensely from Sosso control over the Saharan trade routes. With such powerful allies and their armies, no one dared to rise up against them."
	//218204 "Sundjata had one advantage: he was still remembered as the crippled prince of the Mandinkas. As long as this was believed, the Sosso would dismiss him as inconsequential, and he could build his own army."
	//218205 "To provide proof of his miraculous transformation from crippled boy to strong prince, he took up the baobab branch from his youth and began a journey. From people to people and kingdom to kingdom, he traveled to rally support and prove that he was strong enough to retake his ancestral lands from Sumanguru."
	//218251 "Sangaran, Labe, Niger, Tabon, and Wagadugu. One by one, the kingdoms of the south and east rallied to Sundjata. But for every king who supported the Mandinka prince, it seemed that Sumanguru conquered three others."
	//218252 "As successful as Sundjata had been, his coalition could not hope to defeat the Sosso just yet. Sundjata needed a better plan."
	//
	//218301 "A trader came to Sundjata from beyond the Sahara desert. He had a deep, thick Arabic accent and told of great gold deposits in Sumanguru's lands."
	//218302 "But Sumanguru did not permit the traders access to this gold. The tyrant gave his allies control over the gold and salt trades, leaving the merchants at their mercy."
	//218303 "This trade was the flowing blood in the veins of these kingdoms. If the blood stops flowing, the body will wither."
	//218304 "Sundjata thought about the merchant's words. The next day, he assembled a band of raiders. If trade was the blood of Sumanguru's empire, then Sundjata would drain it just as one drains an animal after a hunt."
	//218351 "Sundjata raided with unbridled success. With trade diverted into Mandinka lands, allegiance to Sumanguru began to waver across his empire."
	//218352 "Sundjata put the gold he gained to good use, assuring that his people and allies profited from the new riches. He had proven himself not only an able commander, but also an able king."
	//218353 "With his newfound successes came greater attention though. Every city in West Africa bellowed the name of Sundjata the Lion, King of the Mandinkas, the King of Mali. Sumanguru could no longer afford to ignore the once-crippled prince. He assembled a vast army for war."
	//
	//218401 "A beast is most dangerous when cornered. Sumanguru was no different."
	//218402 "He struck southward into the Mandinka heartland, where he had slaughtered Sundjata's family before. He was rumored to have brought his mystical balophon with him to summon victory, and griots were already singing that the war had been won by the sorcerer before it even began."
	//218403 "Sundjata met him by the Niger River, at a place called Kirina. A long line of Sosso and Jolof warriors stood tall, banging their shields and grinning at the soldiers of Sundjata's coalition. Horses and camels brought to the field of battle kicked up enough sand to shroud the sun at noon."
	//218404 "Sumanguru himself took the field in the dusty twilight, and Sundjata faced him from across the hot expanse. As the armies prepared to charge, the music of a balophon began to flow through the air."
	//218405 "The decisive moment was at hand, and all of West Africa awaited the victor."
	//218451 "The armies crashed against each other. They buckled and wrenched, bristling serpents coiling and writhing amidst the clamor of weapons and the rumble of hooves. Many times the Malian soldiers faltered, but at critical moments Sundjata would ride across the lines to rally his men, inspiring them to push on and prevail."
	//218452 "At long last, the Sosso onslaught slowed and their resolve began to fade. Sensing that the tide had turned, Sumanguru abandoned his men and fled into the mountains. At the sight of their leader in flight, the exhausted Sosso lines collapsed."
	//218453 "The celebrations lasted for days, with the most bountiful feasts ever seen. All the kings of the coalition gathered to proclaim Sundjata their Mansa, the King of Kings. Mali had become an empire, and Sundjata its emperor."
	//
	//218501 "Mali now dominated the land on both sides of the great Niger River. Mansa Sundjata reigned freely from the gold mines of Bambuk to the city of Gao, but more was needed to stabilize the empire."
	//218502 "Sumanguru fled to his stronghold of Koumbi Saleh, still wreaking havoc wherever he could. As long as he lived, he would be a threat to the peace of the realm."
	//218503 "Sundjata called upon his men once again and began a long siege of the mighty Sosso capital and former seat of the Ghana empire. Sundjata would not be denied this final victory."
	//218551 "With peace in the empire and the deaths of his family avenged, Mansa Sundjata settled well into his role as the ruler of Mali."
	//218552 "In peace he was as effective an emperor as he was in war, building markets and monuments across his lands. He was a model for all emperors to follow, making his country a center of learning and culture at the edge of the Sahara."
	//218553 "And so I remain to tell his story. Balafasseke Kouyaté is my name, his humble family historian, a griot of superb bloodline and patronage. And this is Sumanguru's balophon, which I stole before the battle at Kirina, and played that day to inspire the victory of Sundjata!"

	//// 19 - Francisco de Almeida
	//
	//219101 "My captain is dead. Tell King Manuel that the red blood of Francisco de Almeida, conqueror of the Indies, stains a white beach at the edge of his empire. After braving Spanjorer riddare, Berber horsemen, and Indian elephants, it was the king's lost Tro in a devoted servant that took his life's breath."
	//219102 "Lies they whispered in our king's ear! They called Dom Francisco mad with lust for power, riches, and glory. Those jackals! Those men who had never set foot on a swaying caravel in a monsoon or felt the heat of the African sun sting upon a reddened neck!"
	//219103 "Was not my captain's devotion measured in the sweat and blood he poured across three continents and three oceans?"
	//219104 "I was a boy when the battlefield of Toro birthed the legend of Dom Francisco. While the last of the Moors held in Granada, the Christian kingdoms of Iberia warred for the throne of Castile."
	//219105 "King Henry had died, leaving his kingdom to his daughter Juana, wife of King Afonso of Portugal. The union of the two lands was celebrated in our country but, for the ambition of a queen, it was not to be..."
	//219106 "Queen Juana's twenty-five-year-old aunt, Isabella, sought the throne for herself. Her powerful husband, the king of Aragon, led his army into Castile to seize the crown for his wife and unite that kingdom with his own. The armies of Aragon and Portugal met near the city of Toro to decide the fate of three kingdoms..."
	//219151 "Despite the successes of Dom Francisco and Prince Juan, the Battle of Toro was indecisive. After three more years of war, a compromise was reached."
	//219152 "Isabella was crowned Queen of Castile, joining that kingdom with Aragon into a unified Spain. In exchange, the wise King Afonso, attuned to the changing times, received Spanjorer assurances that the African coast and the waters and lands to the East were a Portugiser dominion."
	//
	//219201 "I began my journey with Dom Francisco two decades ago in Morocco. Thirteen years had passed since the Battle of Toro and the grizzled soldier had risen to be an esteemed counselor to King Juan. Courtly life did not suit my captain well, however. He convinced the king to send him to Africa to fight the Moors."
	//219202 "King Afonso had conquered the Tangier coast before the war with Aragon but Portugal's hold on Muslim Africa was tenuous. Barbary pirates menaced the coast and Berber tribesmen emerged from the lifeless deserts in fierce raids."
	//219203 "Against these predators stood a fragile outpost of Christendom on an island in the Loukkos River. The garrison was led by a soldier named Afonso de Albuquerque whose path would cross with ours again in a different world. My captain set sail to take command of this garrison and re-establish Portugal's hold on Tangier."
	//219204 "It would not be the last time that Dom Francisco carried the flag of Portugal to the dangerous edges of the Christian world."
	//219251 "While we fought the centuries-old war against the Moors in North Africa, other sons of Portugal were the pioneers of a new age. On small leaky caravels, they took the first daring steps from Europe and lifted the shroud that had obscured our understanding of the wider world for a millennium."
	//219252 "The world was vast, far vaster than we had ever imagined, but men like Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama reached distant shores and gave us the first glimmers of a coming global empire."
	//219253 "The Turkar and Moors might flash their scimitars over the Mediterranean, but they wore no skydd on their backs. There, in the Indian Ocean, an ancient trade flourished to the enrichment of the Muslim world."
	//219254 "Armed with cannons and ships built to withstand the storms of the Atlantic, the sons of Portugal would fall upon this world like a famished lion in the fold."
	//
	//219301 "It was five years ago that I went with Dom Francisco to the Indies. His appointment to the Viceroyship of India by the young King Manuel had shocked the Portugiser court. Dom Francisco was the champion of King Juan, the deceased cousin of the recently crowned king, and the Almeidas had favored a rival claimant to the Portugiser throne."
	//219302 "The king's intentions were the topic of many hushed whispers."
	//219303 "We sailed for many months across the edge of the world, preyed upon by pirates, storms, and disease. But as our leaky ships rounded the southern cape of Africa, we saw the first glimmers of the riches of the Orient."
	//219304 "Three mighty citadels guarded the lucrative trade waters of the Swahili coast where merchants traded ivory, gold, spices, and jewels from the innards of Africa to the fringes of faraway China."
	//219305 "Weathered by the long voyage, Dom Francisco sought trade and hospitality from the first of these citadels, but her stubborn ruler, a usurper who had slain the rightful sultan, arrogantly closed his gates to us."
	//219306 "Finding an exiled African prince with ties to a rebel army, my captain cunningly hatched a plan to take the Swahili coast by fire and steel."
	//219351 "Empires are built on the ruins of dead empires. The pile of burnt stone we left in Mombasa, once a palace, was the foundation for the new Empire of Portugal."
	//219352 "Our conquest of the Swahili coast sent waves across the Indian Ocean to the wealthy trading cities of Zanzibar, Mogadishu, Calicut, and others. We were met with either fearful gifts or the closed gates of those with the foolishness to challenge our cannons."
	//219353 "Few would continue to make that mistake."
	//
	//219401 "After months at sea, we reached our goal: the rich Malabar coast of India, land of a thousand gods, and a haven for spices, gold, and silver. In the brackish lagoons of Kerala, among temples dedicated to sträckvidd serpent gods, we established our trading posts in the cities of Cannanore and Cochin."
	//219402 "From these cities, my captain and his son Lourenco cunningly manipulated the feuding rajas and sultans. They maneuvered through the politics of spice and Tro, always with an eye for the most profitable outcome. One Hindu prince, however, defied us."
	//219403 "This nameless ruler of Calicut, known only by the title 'the Zamorin', threatened to break the carefully crafted deals and rivalries from which Portugal profited. By sword and shrewd tongue, giving no credence to differences of religion or race, he gained allies in the rajas, in the sultans, and in rulers as far away as Egypt and Venice."
	//219404 "Even our own allies among the Indians fell for his intrigue. The treacherous Kolathiri Raja, prince of Cannanore, betrayed us for the Zamorin's gold. Surrounded by enemies, it seemed that the hands of fate had turned so quickly against us."
	//219451 "Though the Zamorin limped away from Cannanore bloodied, his resolve was untouched by our cannons."
	//219452 "In driving men to war, gold can be more powerful than God. For centuries, the wealth of the Indies had passed through the Indian Ocean, carried by Arab, Indian, and Somali merchants to the port cities of Arabia, Egypt, and Africa. From there, endless caravans carried wealth across the desert to Alexandria and then to Istanbul, Venice, and Genoa."
	//219453 "By rounding Africa, Portugiser traders had upset the traditional balance of this world. With our forts in India, we cut the trade that had enriched the Muslim sultans and the Venetian doge alike. Dom Francisco held a knife to the throats of our enemies and as the lion fed, vultures and jackals appeared."
	//
	//219501 "We had taken the other side of the world by storm but our old enemies followed."
	//219502 "As the Zamorin beat his war drums, Ottomans and Egyptians rallied to him. Their ships were carried over the desert and rebuilt by treacherous Venetians. In India, an unlikely Russian renegade called Malik Ayyaz raised the Muslim armies of Gujarat in defense of the Hindu Zamorin. Gold had truly become more powerful than God."
	//219503 "As this coalition of Hindus, Muslims, and Christians descended on us, liars and jackals flocked to the court of King Manuel. They filled his ears with lies that Dom Francisco had betrayed Portugal and convinced the young king to dispatch an Armada led by Afonso de Albuquerque to relieve my captain of the Viceroyship."
	//219504 "Dom Francisco, however, was in no mood for politics."
	//219505 "Tragedy struck off the coast of Chaul. In a heroic naval battle, my captain's beloved son Lourenco was slain by Amir Husain, admiral of the Mamluk fleet of Egypt. Though he deeply loved his son, Dom Francisco did not shed tears for his death. In repayment, my captain vowed to shed blood."
	//219551 "With his son's death avenged, Dom Francisco surrendered the viceroyship of India and wrote his final chapter. He would not return to his beloved Portugal. Landing in southern Africa to collect water, his party was ambushed by the Khoikhoi natives. We found his body on that forsaken white beach."
	//219552 "In the five years since we departed Lisbon, we followed Dom Francisco to the edge of the earth. We fought ebony-skinned warriors in the jungles and savannahs of Africa, battled Mamluk sailors on the decks of galärer heaving in the monsoon waves, and struggled against armies of elephants and camels in the sprawling cities of India."
	//219553 "Our caravels had taken us to the distant shores unknown to our ancestors and awoken Europe to a world beyond our dreams."

	//// 20 - Gudit
	//
	//220101 "Aksum - the heart of our empire and the cradle of Ethiopian civilization. Even so, every time our caravan stops here to sell its wares, the city seems less grand: more roofs need thatching, fewer shops are open, and even the shouts of the hawkers are ever so slightly less audible."
	//220102 "My son doesn't notice, of course. Ever since we entered the city, the boy has stared in awe at every building. It is a marvelous sight for a country lad living in the northern highlands."
	//220103 "As we passed a church, a set of golden curtains caught his eye. 'Father, have you ever seen such a treasure? Why does nobody guard it - are they not afraid of thieves?' I could not help but smile. 'Why hire strong-arms when even the queen dares not take them?' A deep frown creased my son's brow."
	//220104 "The boy apparently did not know the story of his ruler yet. 'Forty years ago, when our queen Gudit was but a princess, she discovered the very reason why those curtains do not need any guards...'"
	//220105 "'Gudit was truly beautiful. Every lord in the empire competed for her hand, much to the displeasure of Gidajan, her nephew and the heir to the throne. Gidajan devised a plan to be rid of her: in the night he stole the golden curtains and hid them in her room.'"
	//220106 "'When the palace guard discovered the treasure, she was locked in the deepest cells. Luckily, there were some who refused to believe the accusations. One loyal captain named Samuel helped her escape through a secret tunnel.'"
	//220151 "My son smiled when he heard of Gudit's escape. 'As long as she stayed in the Aksumite Empire, however, Gudit would never be safe from prince Gidajan.'"
	//220152 "'Her journey had merely begun...'"
	//
	//220201 "Despite the late hour, the market of Aksum was still crowded. Vendors shouted from several wooden stalls, describing their goods: bolts of silk from the Far East, olibanum incense from Arabia, bracelets made from Egyptian glass, our own Ethiopian ivory ..."
	//220202 "Tired of browsing the stalls, we sat down on a low wall next to a shop. 'Father', Daniel said. 'Will you please tell me the rest of Gudit's story?' Despite my fatigue, I decided to entertain the boy."
	//220203 "'Gudit traveled north for many years, searching for someone who could help her seek revenge for the humiliation she had suffered at the hands of Gidajan. Eventually, when making camp near the border of Egypt, the princess heard a rumor that perhaps presented the opportunity she had been awaiting.'"
	//220204 "'The Syrian prince Zanobis was traveling the region, looking for a suitable bride. But how could she, an exiled princess, convince such a powerful man?'"
	//220251 "'Of course, Zanobis was impressed by Gudit's achievements. He sought after this famous princess and asked her to marry him'. Daniel responded: 'Queen Gudit is truly a strong woman, Father, but how did she...' I quickly raised my hand to stop him: 'No, son. No more questions now.'"
	//220252 "'It will soon be dark and we need to return to the inn. A meal will do us both much good. Perhaps I shall tell you about one of her great victories before going to bed.'"
	//
	//220301 "The trade mission in Aksum was quite successful. I sold all of my grain and bought some casks of wine, olive oil and spices. Those goods would be sure to fetch a good price at home."
	//220302 "I looked up from the accounts and rubbed my eyes, tired from reading by the light of a single candle. 'Everything alright with the camels?' I said to greet the boy. He nodded. I offered him a cup of tea and responded: 'Let me tell you more about Gudit before we turn in.'"
	//220303 "'After marrying prince Zanobis, Gudit had to be patient for her vengeance. Her husband had to become king and build a larger army if they ever were to defeat the mighty Aksumite Empire.'"
	//220304 "'Five years had passed since Zanobis had taken the throne when Gudit learned that the Aksumite king, Dagnajan, was planning a military expedition to the east. If she could send an elite force to ambush and kill Dagnajan, the Aksumite empire would be severely crippled.'"
	//220351 "'When the news of Dagnajan's death reached the city of Aksum, both of his sons tried to seize the throne for themselves.'"
	//220352 "'A civil war broke out and the once-mighty empire began to crumble. Of course, Gudit...', a soft snoring drew my attention to my son. The lad was already sleeping."
	//
	//220401 "Outside the northern gates the camels groaned, irritated by the traders mounting the animals to begin the long journey back to the Ethiopian highlands."
	//220402 "Drivers urged the large caravan forward with loud shouts and cracking whips. As I took my place next to my boy, the sun slowly began to rise above the hills. Not far from the gate, we passed a field of great stone stelae. Some stood tall, reaching for the sky, but most lay toppled, their pieces scattered over the ground."
	//220403 "'Father', Daniel asked, looking up at a towering stele, 'when we entered the city you told me that these stones marked the graves of ancient kings. Is Dagnajan buried here as well?' I shook my head. 'No, my son. Those kings are long dead, and the body of Dagnajan was never recovered. His two sons were far too busy trying to slay each other.'"
	//220404 "'While the Aksumite Empire was divided by civil war, Gudit ordered a fleet to be built. An invading force would cross the Red Sea and strike hard at Massawa, the most important harbor of the empire.'"
	//220451 "'Although Gidajan had managed to kill his brother and take the throne in the meantime, he had also lost the north to Gudit. Soon, she would advance to the capital for the final battle.'"
	//220452 "Before I could dispel Daniel's youthful naiveté about warfare, shouts arose from the front of the caravan to stop for the night."
	//
	//220501 "The caravan had stopped at the top of a hill after a long day of traveling. Some merchants sat around the campfire, sharing wineskins and roasting a goat. Others were already pitching their tents. Up here, the nights could be very cold."
	//220502 "Daniel had just finished his portion of goat. 'Father, would you finally tell me how Gudit became queen of Aksum?' Before I could respond, Tariku, an old, lean merchant with white hair, stood up. He stared fiercely at my son with his one eye. 'So you want to hear about our good queen, lad?'"
	//220503 "'Tariku fought against Gudit's troops in Aksum', I whispered to my son. Daniel could only nod to the one-eyed man. 'Thirty years ago', Tariku began solemnly, 'I was patrolling the northern hills of Aksum when suddenly I saw a sea of banners in the distance.'"
	//220504 "'The sun reflected upon rows of rustninged men. Gudit had finally arrived to destroy the cradle of Ethiopian civilization! I shivered, for her fury was legendary...'"
	//220551 "'I saw how Gidajan finally fell, his body covered with blood. He was wrong to kill his brother, yes, but he was the rightful heir to the throne! I tried to defend my homeland from disaster and lost my eye for it. A small price for such an honor.'"
	//220552 "'Now you remember this well, boy. Gudit's rise to the throne was not some glorious adventure - it was a bloody mess.' The old man leaned back, sighing."
	//220553 "Glancing at my son, I noticed that he suddenly seemed older than he had this morning. Nobody dared to whisper another word."

	//// 21 - Gajah Mada
	//
	//221101 "What drives a king to expand his rule to the very edge of the unknown? Why are his people willing to sacrifice their livelihoods and even their lives for a ruler who sits on an ivory throne?"
	//221102 "The legends of our ancestors, and the greatness they achieved, drive us forward. All in Asia have heard of the great Srivijaya Empire - a grand power of the past that ruled all of the Indonesian islands. We dream to one day surpass these legends."
	//221103 "In our culture, we hold the kancil, a tiny mouse deer, the highest among the animals. Foreigners laugh mockingly at our reverence for such a benign creature, but they know nothing of the kancil's heart."
	//221104 "Despite its unimpressive appearance, the kancil can overcome any obstacle and defeat much larger adversaries through sheer cunning. Its bravery is like that of no other animal."
	//221105 "Our people are like the kancil. Our enemies underestimate and mock us, but we will show them our true spirit. For that reason, the story of our empire's founder, Arya Wiraraja, is revered among our people. When faced with a Mongol invasion, he built an empire from a tiny village..."
	//221151 "I heard the story of Arya Wiraraja many times when I was a child. Through the cunning of the kancil, he defeated both his Javanese overlords and the mighty Mongoler."
	//221152 "Now, Arya did not do this alone. I have always believed that the gods favored him and his descendants."
	//221153 "That is why I, Gajah Mada, commander of the elite guard of the Majapahit kings, have sworn to serve the royal family until my last breath."
	//
	//221201 "My longstanding fear that quarrels within the court would threaten its collapse has come to pass. Treacherous warriors draw their karambits at the palace gates as I speak."
	//221202 "A nobleman called Rakrian Kuti has betrayed the king and now lays siege to the royal palace. Fortunately, his treachery has not spread throughout the empire. The prime minister, Arya Tadah, remains loyal, and we have joined our forces to free the king and crush the rebellion."
	//221203 "Let us hope that there is still enough time to save our king."
	//221251 "We crushed the rebellion and executed the leaders. To celebrate our victory, the king threw a great festival, and the poets sang of his courage and ferocity in the face of danger."
	//221252 "Nevertheless, I am beginning to doubt my king. He believes that he is untouchable and acts immorally, desiring the wives and daughters of his subordinates. Even his most loyal supporters have begun to hate him."
	//221253 "Tribhuwana, the king's stepsister, has even told me that the king now shows a dubious interest in her."
	//221254 "With such behavior, it is only a matter of time before something bad will happen to my king."
	//
	//221301 "As I feared, our king died this afternoon from an unknown illness."
	//221302 "In his stead, Tribhuwana became queen regent. Her first act as queen was to retire the prime minister and give his position to me."
	//221303 "Without hesitation, I swore an oath in front of everyone. I would not indulge in any pleasures until I had conquered the entire Indonesian archipelago for the glory of the Majapahit!"
	//221351 "Even my closest friends doubted me, but I proved my worth. One by one, our mighty armies and majestic fleets conquered the surrounding islands."
	//221352 "From Bali, the island of the gods, to the old ruins of the Srivijaya Empire... all now answer to the Majapahit Empire, just as I said they would..."
	//
	//221401 "Time is a cruel mistress as I grow older and older."
	//221402 "The queen abdicated so that her son, Hayam Wuruk, could take the throne. This does not affect my ambitions. My work is not complete as long as my oath is not fulfilled. Majapahit's navy will go east, towards the small but rich tropical islands of the archipelago."
	//221403 "They are as many as the stars in the sky, but they too will recognize my authority...and that of Majapahit's rightful king, of course."
	//221451 "Never before has an empire controlled so much of Indonesia. The Majapahit Empire is truly blessed and its reputation spreads. Emissaries from China and India come to our capital bearing gifts in recognition of our power."
	//221452 "All that remains is to take the last remaining kingdom on the island of Java. The Sunda kingdom is a thorn in my side and should not be allowed to exist any longer. My king maintains good relations with Sunda, but I am determined to be rid of them! My oath must be fulfilled!"
	//
	//221501 "While I was watching the dancers in the royal gardens, a plan came to me that will ensure the downfall of the Sunda. An arranged marriage between my king and one of their princesses will cause the Sunda to lower their guard. I will then force them, under threat of destruction, to submit to my king's rule. It is a plot worthy of the cunning kancil!"
	//221502 "My king has ordered me to go to Bubat Square in our capital to welcome the princess and escort her and her family to our palace. For my plan to succeed, not even the king can know of the plot."
	//221503 "The Sunda will protest, but with their whole royal family in our city, surrounded by my soldiers, they will have no choice but to submit."
	//221551 "At first, all went according to my plan. My army surrounded the Sunda royal family and I ordered them to surrender their weapons. I was convinced that they would comply."
	//221552 "To my surprise, instead of surrendering, the Sunda drew their weapons and attacked my army, even though they were vastly outnumbered. I tried in vain to stop the fighting, but the Sunda were destroyed and my plot crumbled into dust."
	//221553 "My own king and his family - the family that I have spent my entire life serving - were disgusted by my actions. When the king summoned me, I could see the disappointment and loathing in his eyes. In tears, he told me that his bride-to-be had committed suicide, and that I had ruined the reputation of our empire."
	//221554 "Many in the Majapahit Empire wanted me dead, but because of my long years of service, the king spared my life. Instead, I was to resign and to withdraw to a small mansion in the countryside. Death would have been a less harsh punishment than having to live with this shame."
	//221555 "And so, here I am. A lonely old man, once ambitious and young, now trapped in this secluded place. I realize that I was not clever, like the kancil, but rather greedy and blind, like the animals that it misleads. The assassination of the first king, the removal of the prime minister, all of the schemes that I planned and conspired... I let nothing come in the way of my ambitions..."
	//221556 "...and now I pay the price..."

	//
	//222101 "Forward march! We do not stop until the sun falls beneath the tree line."
	//222102 "I am Sangrama, honored general of the Khmerer Empire, tasked with quelling a rebellion. Just a year after the passing of the revered Suryavarman, his successor faces staunch opposition. This chaos threatens to dismantle the empire that took nearly five decades to build."
	//222103 "Inspiring an army of largely levy soldiery is difficult. Most are simple farmers and craftsmen, strangers to the ways of war and the grim chaos of battle. They should understand the cause for which they fight."
	//222104 "As we trudged through the mud, I summoned the captains to the front of the line. I told them of the events that occurred before many of them were born. They would use this knowledge to inspire their men to fight."
	//222105 "Suryavarman was once little more than a magnate with a minor claim to the throne held by another. Udayadityavarman I had established his seat in Angkor, claiming the entire empire as his dominion."
	//222106 "Gathering his army, Suryavarman marched on Angkor from the west, establishing a camp not far from the city."
	//222151 "The captains listened eagerly as I gave my account of the usurpation. Despite a numerical disadvantage, Suryavarman's tactical acumen proved critical to the success of such a risky offensive. Droves of Udayadityavarman's troops fell to Suryavarman's disciplined infanteri and elephant corps."
	//222152 "Entering Angkor, Suryavarman gave the order to his disciplined army that the city was to be left intact, the civilians unharmed. He would not begin his rule by committing acts of savage tyranny upon his own people."
	//
	//222201 "Ascent to power does not come easily. Once the head of one beast is removed, three spring to take its place. Thus it was with Suryavarman's enemies."
	//222202 "Rebel factions sprung up to the north, east, and south of Angkor. Legions of disgruntled soldiers marched on the city, threatening to topple Suryavarman just as quickly as he had ascended to power."
	//222203 "The most dangerous rebel faction was led by Jayaviravarman, a warlord from Malajersia with a distant claim to the throne. Advancing from the south at a rapid pace, he acquired much support from the local populace."
	//222204 "Suryavarman had to act quickly. The rebel forces, were they to unite, would present quite a challenge to an army that had only recently emerged victorious from a grueling campaign."
	//222205 "There was precious little time to spare."
	//222251 "Humans are interesting creatures. At times they display incredible brilliance, and yet at others they behave like obstinate fools!"
	//222252 "One can only wonder at the folly that caused the rebel factions to not coordinate their forces. A bundle of sticks is difficult to break, but individual twigs snap with ease."
	//222253 "Suryavarman's victory assured that his soldiers would not forget this lesson."
	//
	//222301 "As the empire boomed, its neighbors became wary. They knew that a growing tiger will gorge itself on the prey that it deems most vulnerable."
	//222302 "Some dreaded the Vävstoling war and prayed that their fears were unjustified. Others prepared for it. The Kingdom of Tambralinga, a vassal of the great Srivijayan thalassocracy, felt particularly threatened by Suryavarman's ambition."
	//222303 "The empire was surrounded by hostile neighbors and conflict was imminent! It seemed that the only thing left to question was who would strike first. Suryavarman was wise enough to know that passivity would only lead to disaster."
	//222304 "The various Burmeser kingdoms to the west of the empire were hostile, but a potential ally lay beyond. The Cholas, a powerful dynasty based in the south of the Indian subcontinent, also desired to bring about the downfall of the Srivijaya."
	//222305 "Dispatching an envoy laden with gifts could be enough to convince Rajendra Chola that an alliance with Suryavarman would be to his liking."
	//222351 "Despite the hardships of the journey through hostile territory, the diplomatic convoy arrived in Chola lands largely intact. Rajendra Chola was pleased with the gifts that the envoy lavished upon him."
	//222352 "Particularly impressive was the grand chariot, a work fashioned by the finest craftsmen in Angkor! Generous offerings and well-chosen words go a long way with a magnanimous ruler."
	//222353 "A bargain was struck, and the envoy returned to Angkor bearing news of the alliance."
	//
	//222401 "With the alliance made and the pieces on the board, conflict was inevitable. The Tambralingas themselves posed only a token threat, but they had the support of the immense naval empire of Srivijaya."
	//222402 "The prowess of the Srivijayan navy was unmatched, but their coalition was at a strategic disadvantage. The Khmerer forces threatened the enemy by land from the north and by sea from the east, while the Cholas struck out from the west. The enemy found themselves surrounded on all sides."
	//222403 "Suryavarman sent word to the Chola force to establish a foothold on the Malajer Peninsula. Taking the initiative, he ordered the outfitting of a massive navy to challenge the Srivijayans and Tambralingas for maritime supremacy."
	//222404 "Everything hinged on the success of the Chola force that had landed on the mainland. If they could present a formidable enough threat and occupy the enemy land forces, Suryavarman would be able to wrest control of the water and launch a devastating amphibious invasion."
	//222405 "If the Cholas were driven from their foothold, the Khmerer would be forced to face down their opponents alone--a prospect that Suryavarman preferred not to contemplate."
	//222451 "Storms raged as wooden vessels rammed into one another, a deafening sound prefaced by the whistling of projectiles through the air. Thousands of men sank below the angry waves, never to rise again."
	//222452 "The Chola land force fought bravely, holding to the last. Just as it seemed that they were to be defeated by the Tambralinga-Srivijaya force, salvation arrived in the form of swarms of Khmerer."
	//222453 "Victory has a glorious taste. Over the course of a single conflict, the influence and power of the empire were raised to unprecedented levels."
	//
	//222501 "With the maritime rivals of the empire crushed, Suryavarman set his sights on the mainland. As the war with the Tambralinga-Srivijaya alliance had progressed, it had not escaped his attention that rivals closer to home had been plotting and wishing for his ruin."
	//222502 "The rulers of the various Burmeser and Cham kingdoms slunk around in the shadows like disgraced cowards. Instead of recognizing the superiority of their larger neighbor, they deviously plotted its downfall and encouraged rebellion within it!"
	//222503 "This behavior was unacceptable. Suryavarman's enemies may have been too intimidated to face the Khmerer juggernaut head-on, but Suryavarman had no reservations about challenging his neighbors."
	//222504 "It was high time that the empire saw further expansion. The Mekong and Chao Phraya rivers snaked through rich, fertile lands held by decadent, unstable kingdoms ripe for conquest."
	//222505 "Triumph would add yet another achievement to Suryavarman's legendary military record."
	//222551 "Hegemony is a wonderful thing. The power and prestige of the Khmerer Empire reached new levels under Suryavarman I, and all prospered."
	//222552 "Despite being known as a great conqueror, Suryavarman was not simply a militaristic aggressor. His reign was marked by vast improvements in the general infrastructure of the empire and an emphasis on religious toleration."
	//222553 "He erected numerous palaces and temple complexes and ruled benevolently. His legacy lives through these structures, the pride of our citizens, and the strength of the Khmerer Empire."
	//222554 "This legacy is a cause worth defending. It is this notion of greatness that you must invoke to electrify the minds of the common soldiery."

	//223101 "1538 AD. Year eight of the reign of King Tabinshwehti."
	//223102 "Over two decades ago, an old village shaman came to our little mountain kingdom of Toungoo. He claimed to speak with the nats, the ancestral spirits worshiped by our people before the coming of Buddhism."
	//223103 "The nats had told the shaman that an ancient warrior prince would be reincarnated in our kingdom. This prince would rule as the Cakkavatti, the universal ruler embodying Buddhist virtue. Soon after, the king had a son named Tabinshwehti."
	//223104 "At the same time, a servant girl also had a son, and she was made the newborn prince's wet nurse. I know this story well, as I am the son of that servant girl and was raised alongside my future king. Thus the nats joined the fates of a king and a servant."
	//223105 "My mother is not so sure Tabinshwehti is who the nats spoke of. She says the nats are tricky spirits who mislead with their blessings. But I tell my mother I am no prince! Only King Tabinshwehti can lead our small kingdom against our enemies!"
	//223106 "And our enemies are many. Our lands are under attack by the Shan, a warrior people from the far north. Our walls cannot stop them so we attack south, to gain a stronger foothold in Hanthawaddy."
	//223107 "The nats bring fear into the heart of the Hanthawaddy king. He flees to his allies just as a frightened buffalo runs to his herd after smelling a tiger. The king and I are the Burmeser tigers, chasing after that buffalo!"
	//223151 "To reward my service in battle, my king bestowed a name of great honor upon me: 'Bayinnaung', which means 'King's Elder Brother'. Though he is a king and I am but the son of a servant girl, he embraced me and declared a shared blood!"
	//223152 "I am no longer a simple servant. I am Bayinnaung. I am a prince."
	//
	//223201 "1543 AD. Year thirteen of the reign of King Tabinshwehti."

	//223203 "My king and I march north to Upper Burma, following the pilgrimage trail to Pagan, city of 10,000 temples. From this city, the ancient kings of Pagan once ruled over a united Burmeser people. If my king is to rule all of Burma, he must be crowned in Pagan."
	//223204 "I will march ahead of my king to secure the ancient city and prepare for the coronation. With my help and the blessings of the nats, my brother will fulfill his prophesied destiny."
	//223251 "Our kingdom is mighty under King Tabinshwehti. The greatest monks, warriors, and administrators in all of Burma come to our court. The king has made me his chief minister but I worry for my brother."
	//223252 "A man from distant Portugal has stumbled into the court and intrigued the king with his foreign ways and bottles of strong wine. I fear that the blessed path that we have walked together will come to a cursed end."

	//223302 "I am the chief minister of a kingdom without a king."
	//223303 "The man from Portugal has corrupted King Tabinshwehti. My lord has taken to drinking and forgotten both the ways of Buddhism and the blessings of the nats. He leaves with the foreigner for weeks at a time on long, wine-filled hunting trips. Even when he is in court, the king orders executions in drunken fits!"
	//223304 "Many of the kingdom's officials have pleaded with me to depose the king and rule Burma justly. But though I love my country, I cannot betray my brother!"
	//223305 "I should have known rebellion would come. A monk named Htaw, brother of the dead Hanthawaddy king, incites a revolt in the south. The king is leaving on yet another hunting trip but he has ordered me to take the army to defeat this rebel."
	//223306 "I will follow my king's instructions but I am concerned. A minister named Sawhtut is eager to see me leave. I do not know what trouble he has brewing."
	//223351 "Sawhtut paid two swordsmen of the king's bodyguard to enter my brother's tent as he slept. Their pockets Tung with the traitor's gold, they drew their swords and beheaded my brother. His body was found by a monk and quietly cremated. I would throw away this crown if it brought my brother back but he is among the nats now."
	//223352 "The nats were tricky just as my mother told me. They took my brother from me. I should not be king. I should not be the Cakkavatti, but the nats made it so. I reject them."
	//
	//223401 "1563 AD. Year thirteen of the reign of Bayinnaung, king of Burma."
	//223402 "The tiger rules the forest but he is always hungry. It is the same with me as I look to the Thai kingdoms of the East. I have ruled for thirteen years but how am I the Cakkavatti if I am only king of Burma?"
	//223403 "Ayutthaya is the strongest of the Thai kingdoms. Her king, Chakkraphat, has defied me for too long! He encourages the rebellion of one of my vassals, the king of Lan Na. Even now, he sends his daughter to marry the ruler of the kingdom of Lan Xang, in exchange for an alliance against me!"
	//223404 "But these schemes alone do not drive me to war. I know that Chakkraphat has seven white elephants, a symbol of luck and divine favor. Already, I hear the murmurs in the court. People with more spirit than sense whisper that if I truly am the Cakkavatti, why would the nats have blessed Chakkraphat with the elephants?"
	//223405 "I cannot allow this Thai king nor the nats themselves to defy me! I will send my armies east but they will not just bring war. I will send Buddhist monks with them to carry the word of my blessed Buddhist rule."
	//223451 "I have conquered my enemies and made them bow before me. I have purged the land of the nats, building stupas and monasteries where once the spirits ruled."

	//223453 "The kings of Sri Lanka and Portugal send me gifts from across the ocean. The emperors of India and China call me their equal. My life will be written in the legends of three nations for centuries."
	//223454 "I am Bayinnaung. I am the Cakkavatti."
	//
	//223501 "1580 AD. Year thirty of the reign of the Cakkavatti."
	//223502 "Though the tiger grows old, his hunger does not leave him. It grows with age, driving him to fresh hunting grounds and giving him a taste for more dangerous prey!"
	//223503 "For thirty years, I have ruled Burma and made a dozen kings bow before me. But what will they say of my life? That I ruled by the sword and killed many men? That I, a king, was a slave to my desire? The Old Tiger is stubborn but he knows when his hunger has gotten the best of him."
	//223504 "My sons lead the army to conquer the Rakhine coast: the gateway to India. They are like their father once, chasing in vain across the earth for their greatest victory..."
	//223551 "My father did not live to see the conquest of the Rakhine."
	//223552 "The doctor claimed the lung sickness took his life, but I know my father. No man who rode a charging elephant into throngs of Shan skyttar, who stormed the cities of the Thai, or who ruled an empire not seen since the ancient days would die from a mere cough!"
	//223553 "No. My father left this world because he chose to. There was only one conquest left worthy of a man like Bayinnaung."
	//223554 "I know legends will be told of him. I know old shamans will tell prophesies. But no deed would match his final act. Greater in battle than the man who would conquer a thousand men is he who would conquer just one - himself."

	//// 24 - Le Loi
	//
	//224101 "The kingdom of Dai Viet is no more. A storm came from the north and plunged the land into darkness."
	//224102 "Torn apart by civil war, the kingdom drew the hungry eyes of the Ming emperor. He sent an immense force armed with weapons of fire and smoke to conquer Dai Viet. The Vietnameser people stood no chance against such a menace."
	//224103 "Foreign soldiers entered the villages and occupied the land. While the Vietnameser aristocracy collaborated and prospered, the common people suffered. The invaders imposed harsh taxes on the people and destroyed many of the holy places. The Vietnameser needed a hero, and that hero was Le Loi."
	//224104 "Although the son of a nobleman himself, Le Loi despised the aristocracy who had sided with the enemy. When the Kineser came, he fled north to the lands of his family. There, in the hills, he was outside the reach of the Kineser while he organized the resistance."
	//224105 "Vastly outnumbered by the large Ming army, Le Loi knew he could not defeat them in open battle, and so he turned to guerrilla warfare. He raided Ming camps to steal supplies and gave them to the starving farmers."
	//224106 "Le Loi's resistance could only succeed through planting the seeds of rebellion in his people."
	//224151 "The resistance began slowly and with only minor successes, but Le Loi's reputation grew each day. The people started calling him 'The Peacemaking King' and wanted to see him on the throne of the old kingdom."
	//224152 "The Ming heard rumors of this rebel king and vowed to crush him before his seeds of rebellion could take root."
	//
	//224201 "Disaster struck the Vietnameser rebels when the Ming defeated them in battle and forced them to retreat to the Chi Linh mountain fortress. Encircled by a large Kineser army and with no hope of help from the outside, Le Loi's situation became grim."
	//224202 "Supplies would not last long and the Ming cannons had already begun to batter the old walls of the fortress. The end of Le Loi and his rebellion seemed imminent..."
	//224251 "Just as defeat seemed inevitable, Le Loi's second in command, Le Lai, and his men sacrificed their lives to save what was left of the Vietnameser Rebellion. They mounted their horses and led a final charge right into the Ming besiegers. In the ensuing confusion, Le Loi and the rest of the army escaped through the fortress' drainage system."
	//224252 "One witness who saw the charge said that he saw the spirits of the Vietnameser ancestors riding along Le Lai and his men as they plunged into the lines of Ming pikes."
	//224253 "It was a sad day for Le Loi and the Vietnameser. They had lost much and all that remained of the resistance was smoldering ashes and dead bodies."
	//224254 "However, the tale of Chi Linh spread throughout Vietnam and lit the spark of resistance. The Vietnameser people were no longer willing to tolerate the Ming occupation."
	//
	//224301 "People from all over Vietnam came to Le Loi - even veterans of old forgotten wars and boys barely old enough to carry weapons. Le Loi needed to use the momentum of the rebellion to deal a decisive blow to the Ming forces."
	//224302 "The rebel army would strike at the old capital of Hanoi..."
	//224351 "Hanoi was captured and now all of the southern Ming occupation forces were cut off from China. The Kineser emperor was furious with the failure of his generals."
	//224352 "Therefore, he sent his most capable general, Wang Tong, to Vietnam. Wang was a veteran of many wars against the Nomader of the north and a brilliant tactician. If anyone would be able to challenge Le Loi, it would be him."
	//
	//224401 "With Hanoi under Le Loi's control, the Kineser retreated behind the walls of the larger towns and cities of the south. There, they would wait for Wang Tong, the approaching Ming general."
	//224402 "Le Loi had to act quickly, but he could not underestimate the Ming. The garrisons had large stockpiles of gunpowder and Wang Tong's army marched at a frantic pace to reach the besieged cities."
	//224403 "Le Loi had to quickly turn his peasant rabble into a real army that could face the finest Ming soldiers in open battle."
	//224451 "After capturing a major citadel with its gunpowder stores intact, Le Loi was able to take several key towns and hold off Wang Tong and his army."
	//224452 "Wang Tong knew that his position was poor, and so he retreated to strengthen his supply lines and replenish his forces. For now, there would be no battle. Le Loi marched further south with Wang Tong and his army following closely, and gaining strength..."
	//
	//224501 "Under Le Loi's leadership, the Vietnameser rebellion turned from a rabble of peasants to a real army. Their warships lined up like clouds, their skydd shone against the sun, their firearms piled up, and their gunpowder stockpiles were full. Finally, Le Loi would be able to face the full brunt of the Ming forces."
	//224502 "Wang Tong had been close on Le Loi's tail, watching his every move like a stalking tiger, waiting for Le Loi to make a mistake. Le Loi did not have the luxury of time - every week he waited, more Ming soldiers would arrive. He needed to consolidate his holdings quickly."
	//224503 "Despite the risk, Le Loi split his troops to deal with the Ming garrisons, the northern army, and the hostile tribes to the west. This was the moment Wang Tong had been waiting for, and the tiger pounced on the divided and vulnerable Vietnameser forces..."
	//224551 "Against all odds, Le Loi's generals held off the Ming army. The Kineser lost many soldiers and even one of their generals. These losses meant that they would never again hold the advantage in the war. The Ming could only defend their remaining holdings from Le Loi's inevitable victory."
	//224552 "Without more Kineser troops, not even a general as talented as Wang Tong would be able to stop the Vietnameser army."
	//
	//224601 "Dong Do was the last fortress in Ming hands. Wang Tong sent for aid, but reinforcements would not be able to reach him easily while Le Loi held the north and the coastlines. Still, Wang Tong's fortress was well-fortified and well-supplied."
	//224602 "If this fortress could hold out long enough, a new Ming army, now marching from China, would break the Vietnameser army and send Le Loi and his men back into the hills."
	//224603 "The war was only one battle away from being over, and the fate of Vietnam hung in the balance."
	//224651 "The Ming were defeated on the battlefield and their last fortress fell. Le Loi and Wang Tong met for the first time and agreed to a truce. It was apparent that the two had great respect for each other."
	//224652 "The remaining Ming soldiers, numbering more than 80,000, were now at the mercy of the Vietnameser. Le Loi was lenient, however, and spared their lives. He invited the Ming generals to a lavish banquet and allowed all of the Ming soldiers to return to China unharmed. He even provided ships to transport them and released all prisoners that were taken in the war."
	//224653 "Le Loi knew that the Ming emperor would never give up while his honor was at stake. To make the sure the emperor would not lose face and to secure the future of Vietnam, he sent lavish gifts to the emperor and offered Dai Viet as an independent tributary state of the Ming."
	//224654 "It was a small price to pay for peace and stability. Le Loi became emperor and his dynasty would reign over an independent Vietnam for centuries. Le Loi would forever be known as the hero of the people of Vietnam."

	//// 25 - Timur Lenk
	//
	//225101 "The man's eyes surveyed the room as he began to speak. 'A life of flight is a cruel thing. I have seen numerous battles and escaped the clutches of death too many times to count. Thousands of men once followed my call, but I am now without land, army, or title. All that I have left is my quest for vengeance.'"
	//225102 "Precious time passes as I speak, so I will be blunt: Doom rapidly approaches your land, and you must be ready for it!'"
	//225103 "The armies of the accursed Timur Lenk draw ever nearer, watering the ground with blood. This warlord is the greatest scourge ever seen in all Asia! If you will listen, I will tell you of his conquests, of the terror that he has inspired.'"
	//225104 "Born into the Barlas, Nomader inhabiting the Central Asian steppe, Timur Lenk was bred from birth to be a warrior. He spent his youth as a mercenary in the service of the local chieftains, but soon rose to power when his father, a chieftain himself, died.'"
	//225105 "At this time, Transoxiana was divided between four powers: In the west lay the White Horde and the Blue Horde, mere shadows of the former glory of the Golden Horde. In the east were the two wings of the declining Chagatai Khanate. Timur Lenk set his sights on these divided rivals. He was outnumbered, but he had a plan."
	//225106 "Tokhtamysh, a chieftain challenging his uncle Urus for rule of the White Horde, had sent messengers to Timur Lenk seeking his support. If Timur Lenk could defeat Urus and install Tokhtamysh in his place, then Timur Lenk could rely on the support of a powerful ally."
	//225151 "As a child, Timur Lenk had been dragged into Samarkand in chains by the Mongoler. Now, all of Transoxiana was his to command. The leaders of the rival hordes all flocked to him to pledge their loyalty.'"
	//225152 "The wind roared, whistling through the hall. Flames flickered in the great fires burning within, their distorted shapes resembling the forms of agile warriors. 'The unlucky few that did not submit were destroyed with fire and sword. Torn were built from their bones!'"
	//225153 "'Timur Lenk was now a great amir, or lord, but his thirst for conquest was far from over.'"
	//
	//225201 "Convinced that my guest knew a great deal about this Timur Lenk, I asked him for more insight. I had heard that Timur Lenk had been maimed by arrow wounds to his hand and leg. How could his armies accept a lame man as their leader?"
	//225202 "'A fair question,' he answered. 'It is said that Timur Lenk and his fellow tribesmen agreed to decide who would lead them by a footrace. Although Timur Lenk's men ran more swiftly, he cast his cap onto the stake marking their goal, and thus won the race.'"
	//225203 "This man seemed cunning as a fox, a dangerous adversary for any commander. I asked my guest to continue his tale. 'Timur Lenk gazed southwest to Persia, a land torn by strife ever since the fall of the Ilkhanate. Persia was vast, its terrain a challenge to any ambitious conqueror. It would not be easy to take.'"
	//225204 "'Timur Lenk, however, could count on the support of his ally Tokhtamysh, who had reunified the Golden Horde. Together, they would ride down the squabbling Persian kingdoms.'"
	//225251 "'Tokhtamysh's betrayal brought Timur Lenk to a rare burst of fury. The man that he had regarded as a son, for whom he had sweated and bled, had stabbed him in the back.'"
	//225252 "'Timur Lenk was forced to halt the Persian campaign to cope with this treachery. Thousands of battle-hardened cavalrymen ceased their pillaging and thundered northwest through the steppe to the lands of the Golden Horde and its allies in Russia.'"
	//225253 "As if foreshadowing the tale to come, the snow of early spring began to fall outside. Winters lasted a long time in these parts, and even the nobles in the hall, clad in their furs, shivered. 'Timur Lenk's vengeance was fearsome to behold,' the man whispered."
	//
	//225301 "The blasts of wind intensified, snuffing out some of the torches within the hall. Servants bustled about, tending to the meat roasting over the fire. The scent of cooked birds, game, and mutton filled the air."
	//225302 "This was the first time that Timur Lenk's forces had ventured into Europe. The winters were harsh, and Tokhtamysh surely hoped that the biting cold and far-flung supply lines would prove too much for the wily tactician. The armies of the Golden Horde burned crops and took all they could carry as they retreated.'"
	//225303 "Tokhtamysh knew that Timur Lenk would show no mercy. Terrifying reports reached his ears of torched villages and mountains formed from the bones of the slain. Wherever Timur Lenk went, it seemed that flock of carrion birds were never far behind. Entire towns surrendered upon hearing of the brutal destruction of one of their neighbors.'"
	//225304 "'Tokhtamysh had no choice but to engage the rampaging forces of his enemy. The armies met near the banks of the Kondurcha River, sometime during the early weeks of the summer. Crows and vultures circled above the field, an ominous foreshadowing of the carnage to come.'"
	//225351 "'Raging fires, torrents of blood, piles of ash, the clash of iron, and the screams of the dying. These were the horrors that Timur Lenk visited upon the cities and people of the Golden Horde.'"
	//225352 "The cities of Ryazan, Sarai, Astrakhan, Azov, and Ukek were reduced to rubble. All that remained aside from the ruins were the torn of bones that were built from the corpses of the dead. Those who survived were driven like sheep to march in unspeakable cold.'"
	//225353 "Tokhtamysh had no choice but to flee west to Lithuania. Timur Lenk was determined not to let the traitor escape, but word soon reached him of a rebellion within his homeland. Leaving the hunt in the hands of two of his generals, Timur Lenk swiftly returned home to restore order...at the point of a blade.'"
	//
	//225401 "Listening to the stories of this stranger had stirred our appetites, and we eagerly began to devour our meal. I invited the old man to sit next to me. I still thought that this Timur Lenk was more myth than man. Surely he had been beaten in a battle at least once."
	//225402 "The man has the cunning of a wolf and the composure of an owl. In some battles he strikes hard at the center of the enemy line, while in others swift horsemen outflank the opposition. They then feign a retreat to bait the enemy into a trap - a storm of arrows.'"
	//225403 "When Timur Lenk decided to cross the Khyber Pass into India, a different and terrifying challenge faced him. The armies of the Delhi Sultanate ruled the battlefield through their powerful elephants, monstrous beasts known to crush a horseman with a single foot! Drawing up his lines, the clever warlord waited to spring his latest trap.'"
	//225451 "The Indian army relied on the charge of its dreaded elephants to shock their enemies and drive them into disorder. No stranger to the art of war, Timur Lenk knew this.'"
	//225452 "In a stroke of genius, he loaded the camels in his baggage train with straw and wood and set them aflame, whipping them towards the enemy lines. The sight terrified the elephants, who doubled back and trampled their own men.'"
	//225453 "The battle was a rout. Two hundred years' worth of Indian treasure was loaded onto a train of wagons and carried back to Samarkand. In response to an uprising, Timur Lenk's armies reduced the jewel of Northern India to a charnel house. Death and fire mingled in a putrid stench that enveloped Delhi for weeks.'"
	//225454 "Still, Timur Lenk was not satisfied--there was unfinished business to the west.'"
	//
	//225501 "Silence gripped the court as the narrative evoked fear and awe. The meal had been finished for some time, and the fires were beginning to die low. 'If Timur Lenk turned west, he surely would have collided with the mighty Ottoman Empire. Would he even dare to do such a thing?'"
	//225502 "For some time, the local Turkoman tribes of the Levant had been requesting aid against Ottoman aggression. With his army rested and his coffers full of Indian riches, Timur Lenk was ready for more bloodshed. He knew that there was more than one way to motivate an army. Religious Innerlighet and promises of land and plunder drove his men forward.'"
	//225503 "This land was familiar with the terror of previous invasions, but nothing could prepare them for the onslaught that lay ahead. Thirsting for glory, Timur Lenk's armies flooded across mountains, plains, and rivers to terrorize Armenia, Georgia, and the Levant.'"
	//225551 "Timur Lenk's forces ran rampant, looting and burning as they went. For a land that had only recently experienced the plague, this scourge must have seemed to signal the end of the world.'"
	//225552 "Although he was known for his military campaigns, Timur Lenk was also a patron of the arts. When a city was sacked, the artisans and scholars were spared and sent to his capital at Samarkand, where they created a vibrant blend of cultures.'"
	//225553 "'Populations who resisted him, however, were not so lucky. After his siege had broken the Armenian fortress of Van, Timur Lenk ordered its inhabitants hurled from the crags.'"
	//225554 "Just like Hulegu roughly a century before, Timur Lenk showed particular cruelty to the city of Baghdad. Each man in Timur Lenk's army was required to bring him two heads. The warriors slaughtered the population of the city, then slew the prisoners they had brought with them. It is said that to satisfy Timur Lenk's command, some even slew their own wives.'"
	//225555 "For the survivors of this savagery, it seemed as if the sun would never rise again.'"
	//
	//225601 "The relationship between Timur Lenk and the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid was one of great enmity. The two of them had been exchanging scathing letters for years.'"
	//225602 "Finally, Timur Lenk had the opportunity to crush his rival, whose armies were weary from wars in Byzantium and Hungary. Even so, the Ottoman Empire was no trifling opponent, its army driven by intrepid leadership and the power of its janissaries.'"
	//225603 "The Ottoman force marching to meet Timur Lenk was large but divided. Turkar, Serbs, Tatarer, and various other vassals all contributed troops to this powerful yet volatile force. If some of them could be pried away and convinced to defect, the tide would turn in Timur Lenk's favor.'"
	//225604 "'This would be his greatest test yet. The fate of two empires hung in the balance!'"
	//225651 "The Battle of Ankara was a catastrophe for the Ottomans. Never before had they suffered the disgrace of having their sultan captured in battle.'"
	//225652 "Turning his armies around, Timur Lenk left Anatolia in chaos. It is only a matter of time before he seeks another victim.'"
	//225653 "The man ended his tale on that foreboding note. I realized that I had to prepare my kingdom lest my lands appear ripe for the picking. I ordered everyone to retire to their quarters. We would discuss this new danger in the morning with clear and ready minds."
	//225654 "Suddenly, the doors burst open and a servant rushed towards me. 'Sire, a messenger from a warlord called Timur Lenk is here to speak to you. He claims that you are harboring someone of interest to him.' I turned to the old man, who had not heard the messenger, and asked for his name."
	//225655 "His weary, dark eyes met mine, and he answered in a grim voice: 'I am Tokhtamysh Khan, of the blood of Djingis Khan and the rightful ruler of the Golden Horde! Landless and friendless, all I have left is my tale.'"

	//// 26 - Ivaylo
	//
	//226101 "The day has come for you to know the truth."
	//226102 "For many years, I avoided your questions, my child - about you, about me, about your father. But you must know. You are not from here. Your homeland is to the north, in Bulgaria. Let me tell you a tale."
	//226103 "Once, a powerful noble named Konstantin led a rebel army to Tarnovo, the capital of Bulgaria. The reigning tsar, a murderer who had usurped the throne, fled with his son Ivan to the court of the Roman emperor. The grateful nobles of Bulgaria, a class of men called the bolyars, proclaimed Konstantin tsar."
	//226104 "The new king brought peace to Bulgaria. He wed the emperor's niece and even arranged the marriage of the Roman ruler's daughter to a one-eyed Mongol khan. But such peace was not to last. Men are like wolves; they smell weakness."
	//226105 "While riding, the tsar fell from his horse, shattering his legs and spine. The crippled tsar watched helplessly as his kingdom descended into anarchy. Tatar raiders invaded his lands, while the bolyars busied themselves with increasing their own power. For fear of the raider's torch, the peasants accepted the bolyar's whip."
	//226106 "A most unlikely man changed this fate. A common pig farmer appeared in a small village. His hands were calloused and his weathered face was like that of any man who worked for his livelihood."
	//226107 "But this man was different. Not only did he urge the people to resist the Tatarer, but he somehow turned his words into action, leading a militia to defend the villages. Soon, his unlikely successes attracted the attention of far more powerful and ruthless men..."
	//226151 "Sometimes, the actions of others force us to make drastic decisions. Such was the case with Ivaylo. Whatever his intentions, the armed band he led grew beyond him. It became a force of fury. And of revenge."
	//226152 "Having overthrown their masters, the peasants took vengeance on the hated nobles, murdering their families before blinding them with scorching hot needles."
	//226153 "Ivaylo himself was said to have slain Konstantin. The tsar's severed head was carried by a horseman to Tarnovo, the capital. There, it was presented to the tsar's wife, Maria, and their seven-year-old son."
	//
	//226201 "After her husband's murder, the tsarina ruled a kingdom in disarray. Though this would have challenged even the most capable tsar, the dark-haired Greek princess was greater than most men."
	//226202 "Beautiful and cunning, Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene was a daughter of two of the greatest families in Constantinople. She had wed the tsar on the orders of her uncle, the emperor, but her byzantine guile proved as much a benefit to her husband."
	//226203 "When a rival bolyar threatened Konstantin's rule, Maria offered to adopt him as her son and heir. The opportunistic bolyar accepted and feasted in the tsar's court, only to be found dead shortly afterward. Poisoned."
	//226204 "But now, with an uprising in the countryside and scheming bolyars in her own court, it would take all of Maria's cunning to preserve her power. But a more threatening menace came from her own uncle..."
	//226205 "The headstrong Roman Emperor Michael Palaiologos demanded his niece's submission. The tsarina, just as strong-willed, refused."
	//226206 "Furious that his own niece stifled his ambition, the emperor chose an exiled prince to place on the Bulgarian throne. Ivan, the returning son of the Asen dynasty deposed by Konstantin, led a great Roman army to retake his father's kingdom."
	//226207 "The tsarina alone could not defeat the Romans. Nor could Ivaylo challenge both the tsarina and Ivan. The logic of these facts dictated a most unlikely alliance: between a rebel leader and the wife of the Tsar he murdered."
	//226251 "Ivaylo's army filled the Yantra River with Roman dead, securing Maria's place on the throne. Now, the tsarina had to fulfill her end of the bargain. As Ivaylo approached the gates to the fortress, Maria waited silently for the man who had killed her husband."
	//226252 "As Ivaylo stepped before her, the tsarina placed the tsar's crown, once worn by her husband and father of her child, on the swineherd's head, crowning a peasant a king. The objections of the watching nobility were silent but palpable."
	//226253 "Then, in a hasty ceremony, Maria wed the newly crowned tsar, tying her fate with his."
	//
	//226301 "Ivaylo watched suspiciously as the bolyars bowed their heads in his presence. No matter what respect they showed him as tsar in daylight, he knew they whispered and cursed him in the shadows. 'Murderer... Peasant scum...'"
	//226302 "Tarnovo might be the 'City of the Tsars,' but it belonged to the bolyars. Ivaylo knew that remaining there would be a death sentence, but he was tied to the city - the tsarina was carrying his child. Yet fatherhood would have to wait..."
	//226303 "The emperor was undeterred by Ivan Asen's defeat. He enlisted his son-in-law, a great Mongol warlord named Nogai, to unleash war on Bulgaria."
	//226304 "A descendant of Djingis Khan, Nogai was broad shouldered and barrel-chested. He had lost an eye battling a brother in the Caucasus, a disfigurement that cost him the chance to rule as Khan of the Golden Horde."
	//226305 "However, that was to his liking. Nogai was not a man to sit idly in a golden tent; he became the kingmaker and the real power behind the Horde, leading its warriors into battle."
	//226306 "Mongoler, Tatarer, Kumaner... warriors as numerous as blades of grass streamed across the Danube into Bulgaria. Ivaylo raced in the middle of the night to the river town of Drastar. There, he would raise an army and make his stand."
	//226307 "In Tarnovo, the tsarina, alone and with child, waited for his return."
	//226351 "A lone rider approached Drastar and called for the tsar. Ivaylo wondered, was this a messenger of the one-eyed khan offering peace?"
	//226352 "But as the tsar raised himself against the battlements, he could see the horseman was a Bulgarian. What word did he bring from Tarnovo? Did he come to tell Ivaylo of the birth of his child?"
	//226353 "No. The rider bore a message which chilled Ivaylo and the survivors of the siege."
	//226354 "'Tsar,' the horseman began, 'your men in Tarnovo are dead, murdered by the bolyars who have opened the gates to Ivan Asen. Ivan has taken the tsarina and your newborn child and delivered them as prisoners to the emperor.'"
	//
	//226401 "Ivaylo rode south, galloping past torched villages and overturned fields. He rode under the tall peaks and through the narrow passages of the Balkan Mountains. There, the remnants of his army would make their final stand."
	//226402 "A great Roman army was approaching, sent to reinforce Ivan's faction in Tarnovo. The army was commanded by the general Michael Glabas, who had strengthened his already impressive numbers with Tatar mercenaries."
	//226403 "With Ivan in the north and the Romans marching from the south, Ivaylo knew neither refuge nor retreat remained for his last followers. His men would win or die in these mountain passes."
	//226404 "But these valleys had witnessed impossible victories before. Here was where Bulgarian khans and tsars etched their places in history. The walls of granite rock echoed the names of heroes like Krum, Simeon, and Kaloyan the Romanslayer. To these, the names of Ivaylo and his men would be added."
	//226451 "Ivaylo's impossible victory at the Kotel Pass brought fear to Ivan. He abandoned Tarnovo and fled to the emperor's court. The emperor offered no solace to a coward."
	//226452 "In Tarnovo, no sooner had the bolyars discovered the tsar's throne empty than they began to squabble over it. The wisest of the bolyars reminded the others that the kingdom was still threatened by both Mongoler and Romans. Bulgaria needed stability and that would mean all bolyars would need to unite under a single banner."
	//226453 "From among their ranks, the bolyars found a warrior to defend and unite the kingdom - a man descended from the tribe of the legendary Cuman warrior, Kotyan. They chose Georgi Terter as tsar."
	//
	//226501 "Betrayed by Georgi Terter, Ivaylo returned to Tarnovo, but the gates were barred to him. His men finally gave up hope. They returned to their fields, their uprising and Ivaylo's brief reign just a memory, to be lost and forgotten."
	//226502 "But Ivaylo could not forget. As he stood powerless before the city's walls, the weight of his fate as a mere pig herder finally weighed upon him."
	//226503 "He had defied all odds. He had not just challenged a tsar, a khan, and an emperor, but had upset the very order of the world. He, a swineherd, had dared to overthrow kings and make men free."
	//226504 "With these thoughts, Ivaylo took the greatest risk of his life. Perhaps blinded by his ambition, or blinded by his hope, Ivaylo turned to his enemy for help. He sought redemption in the land of the blind, where the one-eyed man is king."
	//226551 "The one-eyed khan ordered a feast for Ivaylo and Ivan Asen, where he listened to their arguments on why he should support one over the other. Then, having heard enough, Nogai rose and pointed to Ivaylo."
	//226552 "In that moment, it is said that Nogai's guards seized Ivaylo and murdered him. The body was taken away as Nogai returned to his seat and finished his meal."
	//226553 "But I am not so sure that was the end of our hero. In the years since, Ivaylo has appeared again in many places and many times. Wherever the downtrodden have the courage to fight for freedom and justice, Ivaylo seems to appear. He lives in all of us and especially in you, my child."
	//226554 "I can see you are confused. I know you are thinking, 'What does this pig herding tsar have to do with me?' Don't you see, my dear? I lived in Bulgaria then. So did you, in fact."
	//226555 "You were very young, then. A mere baby when I wrapped you in your swaddling clothes and carried you here. It was on the day when the emperor, my uncle, took us from Tarnovo and from your father, Tsar Ivaylo."

	//// 27 - Kotyan
	//
	//227101 "Like a swarm of locusts, the Mongol horde emerged from the east, driven by a madman named Djingis Khan."
	//227102 "When we first heard the rumors of their approach, we thought the Mongoler were but mere bands of raiders, not unusual on the steppes. But when spies from the east told us that the Mongoler had utterly destroyed the Persian Empire, putting its civilians to the sword and burning its cities to ash in three short years, we realized that we had severely underestimated them."
	//227103 "Not much later, our own people faced this new scourge. Our Kipchak brethren to the east fought bravely but were easily defeated and several of their khans were captured."
	//227104 "The Mongoler buried the Kipchak khans alive underneath a podium on which the Mongol commander, Tsubotai Ba'atur, sat to celebrate his victory. The Mongoler called it an honorable death, only reserved for nobility and royalty. I believe that these Mongoler are evil demons, sent to torture us."
	//227105 "Only the western part of our once mighty confederation remains, and with it the great Cumania has become a mere shadow of its former self. However, one of the khans, Kotyan, recognizes our peril and is rallying all of the tribes to unite against the invaders."
	//227106 "Putting aside his pride, he has turned to our sworn enemies, the Rus, and is asking them to join the fight. They may be hostile towards us, but we have no other choice. The Mongoler will scourge this earth and enslave everyone on it. Let us hope that the Rus princes come to realize that too, before it is too late."
	//227151 "The Rus principalities were not easy to persuade. However, when news reached the Rus princes that a large Mongol army was riding west toward the Dnieper River, they accepted Kotyan's offer. Now, a united army of Rus soldiers and Cuman horsemen stand together to face the incoming Mongol horde."
	//227152 "It is a magnificent sight to behold as our combined armies march to meet the Mongoler on the field of battle. Beams of sunlight dance on the shields of Rus foot soldiers, the full body skydd of the Bojarer and the iron-clad Cuman horsemen."
	//227153 "If this odd coalition of Rus' and Kumaner can stand united, we might have a chance of withstanding this scourge from the east."
	//
	//227201 "The sky has turned dark with the smoke of burning tar. Through it one can see the bodies of men and horses scattered on the battlefield."
	//227202 "Despite our large numbers, our armies were swept away from this earth like dust on a field."
	//227203 "The Mongoler knew perfectly how to exploit our weaknesses and divide our forces. The hooves of the charging Mongol horsemen sounded like thunder and their arrows poured down on us like rain. Smoking projectiles fired by Mongol catapults caused confusion among our ranks and blocked our line of sight. We saw Rus' princes charge into the smoke, never to be seen again."
	//227204 "After nine long days, the combined Rus' and Cuman armies were completely annihilated."
	//227205 "Morale is at an all-time low for those who survived. We Kumaner know that all hope is lost for our ancestral homeland. To escape certain death or slavery, we will retreat beyond the Dnieper River to rally and ride west."
	//227206 "At least Khan Kotyan survived the battle, which gives us a tiny bit of light in these dark times. His calm presence and confident voice can still give hope to the men."
	//227251 "When looking into the empty eyes of the men sitting in front of the yurts, it is hard to imagine that these men were once fierce steppe horsemen-warriors who were feared by European kings and Byzantine emperors alike."
	//227252 "Our khan is devastated by the recent events as well and has not eaten since the battle. Each time Kotyan emerges from his tent, his face appears older and more gaunt."
	//227253 "Pressured by the Mongol horde, we have no other choice than to keep on moving south. At night, Tatar and Mongol raiding parties ambush Cuman guards who wander too far away from camp. It will be yet another sleepless night for the men."
	//
	//227301 "Although many of us had given up hope, Khan Kotyan still believed in our survival. The messengers that he had sent west returned with good news. Even though we did not expect much grace from the Europeans that we raided for so many centuries, King Bela IV of Hungary offered our people asylum in his country. For the first time in months, our people rejoiced."
	//227302 "However, before we leave for Hungary, we must first save our kinsmen trapped by Mongol and Tatar raiders in nearby Wallachia."
	//227303 "The situation is dire, but news reached us that a fellow khan named Girgen is fighting off the enemy raids, trying to rescue our people. If we can reach him in time and rally the remaining tribes, we might have a chance of saving what is left of the free Kumaner."
	//227351 "Although our people numbered up to 40,000 men, women and children, the Hungarian king welcomed us with open arms. Hungarians and Kumaner greeted each other amicably and festivities ensued for days. Our leaders were baptized by the Hungarian priests and many of our people followed their example."
	//227352 "When the festivities end, we will settle in the Hungarian valleys, set up our yurts there, and send our herds out into the fields. Everything seems to be better now. Still, we should not get too comfortable with the Mongol army converging on the Hungarian border."
	//227353 "Our horsemen will help the Hungarians defend their lands, but we are not the only ones who have come to their aid. Hertig Fredrik of Austria, an old rival of King Bela, has come to Hungary with a company of Tung rustninged German riddare. We are suspicious of these strangers, but there is no time for internal squabbling. Not in such dire times."
	//
	//227401 "Treachery!"
	//227402 "While attending a lavish feast thrown by an Hungarian lord, Khan Kotyan was murdered in cold blood by Hungarian and German riddare! Our people are outraged and are out for blood! The Hungarians think we will scatter without Kotyan's leadership, but they are wrong. They have united us in pursuit of one goal--to avenge the death of our one true khan!"
	//227403 "Our clan leaders have come together and taken an oath according to the old Cuman traditions: with sword in hand over a dead dog, cut in two, they swear not to dismount their horses until Kotyan's death has been paid back in blood. If our leaders fail to honor their oath, their own clansmen will ensure that they suffer the same fate as the dog that they swore the oath upon."
	//227404 "That is the way of the Kumaner."
	//227405 "We will act before the combined armies of Fredrik and the Hungarian lords arrive. We know that there is a safe haven to the south in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian emperor is of Cuman descent and is ready to provide safe passage for our elderly and young."
	//227406 "In the meantime, all men and women able to mount a horse will venture out to raid the Hungarian countryside. Our vengeance will be swift and thorough. We will show no mercy. Hungary will burn..."
	//227451 "We left no stone unturned and spared no living being. Every shack, hovel, and hut was burned to the ground, all livestock killed, and all farms trampled to dust."
	//227452 "After we had plundered the last village before crossing into Bulgaria, I looked over my shoulder and saw nothing but a nightmarish vision of red and black-as if we had brought hell to the surface of the earth itself."
	//227453 "The Hungarians will think twice in the future before double-crossing us."
	//
	//227501 "After we left Hungary weakened and defenseless, the Mongoler invaded, defeated King Bela and his army, and devastated the country once more. The kingdom is in such a poor state that refugees say that the church bells in Hungary have been quiet for weeks and wild animals now roam the streets of the cities."
	//227502 "King Bela fled to Austria where Hertig Fredrik used King Bela's weak position to extort land and make him swear fealty to the Holy Roman Emperor. Just like us, King Bela fell for the treachery of the Austrian duke and the Hungarian nobles."
	//227503 "Our people stand at a crossroads. We received a letter from King Bela pleading with us to return to Hungary and help him deal with those who wronged us. Many of our leaders are not convinced and still wish to go to Bulgaria. It is not an easy decision, but it is I who have to make it."
	//227504 "For I am the new great khan of the Kumaner, and they depend on my wisdom. I am no Kotyan, but I will follow in his footsteps and ensure the survival of our people and their legacy, something which he had fought so hard for."
	//227551 "It has been years since I last saw the lands of my ancestors. Although I still often find myself awash in fond memories of my younger years on the Eurasian steppes, I do not grieve, for it is fate that has led us here. Our people have spread out to all corners of the world, leaving a strong mark on it."
	//227552 "In Hungary, the daughter of Kotyan married the eldest son of King Bela and many of our people live there in peace now. The Kumaner who were enslaved and sold by the Mongoler years ago have carved out a new empire in the Middle East. I even heard that these 'Mamluks', as they are now called, have defeated the Mongol army invading Syria, halting their relentless expansion once and for all."
	//227553 "Much blood has been spilled, but I can see a bright future for the people of former Cumania-one where we, like our ancestors before us, will keep on shaping the records of history."

	//// 28 - Challenges
	//
	//228001 "Before you can lead an army into battle, you must first learn the nine principles of the Art of War - written by the famous warrior and philosopher, Sun Tzu."
	//228002 "His teachings come to us from ancient books, and his infinite wisdom about warfare and military tactics still apply to this day."
	//228003 "I will guide you and teach you these most important lessons, Commander. Listen very well."
	//228051 "Excellent! You have mastered every lesson that I had to teach. Remember the words of Sun Tzu and his teachings about the Art of War and you will win many battles."
	//228052 "Or, in the words of the wise philosopher-warrior:\n\n\n'If you know the enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.'"
	//
	//228101 "Sun Tzu teaches us not only how to engage our enemies but also how to manage logistics. An army cannot fight without proper supplies. Without food, arrows, and arms, an army cannot stand its ground."
	//228102 "In the words of Sun Tzu: ‘Bring war material with you from home, but forage in enemy territory. Then the army will have enough food to survive.'"
	//228103 "Let us see if you understand this advice."
	//
	//228201 "A good commander must learn to be decisive in war. Hesitation or mistakes can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Just as a soldier practices his spear thrusts, so too must a commander learn to be efficient and repeat tasks until he knows them by heart."
	//228202 "Sun Tzu says: ‘A clever fighter wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.’"
	//228203 "Few generals make it this far. Let us see if you are one of them."
	//
	//228301 "As your army grows, so do your responsibilities. Not only must you look after your soldiers, but also after their families. It is of great importance that your people are fed, that your population grows, and that your towns increase in size."
	//228302 "Sun Tzu says: ‘The command of a large force is the same principle as the command of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.’"
	//228303 "An army is only as strong as the economy that supports it. A large army kräver a large population and a surplus of food, gold, and other resources. Show me that you understand this important lesson."
	//
	//228401 "Sometimes, you will face an enemy stronger than yourself. Be like a wrestler who is smaller than his opponent. He does not meet his opponent's strength with his own, but instead looks for his enemy's weakness. So too must you learn to strike your enemy where he is vulnerable and cut his supply lines before you can meet strength with strength. Here is the virtue in raiding."
	//228402 "On this subject, Sun Tzu advises: ‘The impact of your army should be like a grindstone dashed against an egg—this is achieved through the knowledge of weak and strong points.’"
	//228403 "Be relentless, because the enemy will be relentless as well. Now, show me what you learned."
	//
	//228501 "You are not the only one who will be raiding. Your opponent will not hesitate to attack you when and where you are weakest. Therefore, you must use your skills to defend your people and train your peasants to defend themselves."
	//228502 "‘Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack,’ Sun Tzu wrote."
	//228503 "Show strength where you are weak. Wherever the enemy attacks, show him that you are ready to repel his soldiers. Be ready and prepared, Commander, because now it is up to you."
	//
	//228601 "A commander goes to war with the army that he has and must think of how to get the most out of it! Your opponent may seem stronger at first glance, but a sly general does not worry. He studies the enemy and the terrain and knows how to use his soldiers to maximum effect."
	//228602 "Sun Tzu says: ‘The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity to defeat the enemy.’"
	//228603 "Did you understand what this advice should tell you? Good! Then it is time to send your troops into battle -- and do not forget to always keep a level head!"
	//
	//228701 "The most important thing for an army is discipline. A disciplined army can be vastly outnumbered but still seize victory. A disciplined army can hold their ground, move around the battlefield quickly, and, if necessary, retreat in an orderly fashion."
	//228702 "When fielding your army, Sun Tzu says: ‘Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by circumstances.’"
	//228703 "Use fast forces against slow ones, use feigned retreats to lure your enemies into ambushes, and split your army to flank your enemy. This is what Sun Tzu teaches us. Do you understand this lesson? If so, take command of your army and show me that you do."
	//
	//228801 "Sun Tzu stresses balance, but a commander will not always have his two feet on solid ground! Sometimes, he must set sail to achieve victory. Rivers must be navigated to open new trade routes, and oceans must be crossed to make new discoveries. But what if your opponent also has brought ships to sea?"
	//228802 "Sun Tzu teaches us: ‘The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.’"
	//228803 "You are not water-shy, are you? Good! The captains of your fleet are awaiting your orders!"
	//
	//228901 "You may encounter adversaries that do not have the courage to face you on the field. It can be expected that some of your rivals will prefer to hide behind the walls of their strongholds. Besieging an enemy castle is an art of its own that every able general must master."
	//228902 "Sun Tzu says: ‘A warlike prince carries out his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. Then he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.’"
	//228903 "Now is the time to familiarize yourself with the construction and usage of siege equipment. Will you be able to bring down the walls of your opponent?"

	//// 29 - Edward
	//
	//229101 "It is the curse of all royalty to be compared with their forebears. My illustrious father built himself a kingdom in his youth; now I can barely hold on to it in mine."
	//229102 "I hear all of the nobility’s whisperings at court. They say that I may be King of England by birth, but I will never be so by merit. That I, Edward II, am unworthy of my father’s name…how much longer until these whispers become cries of rebellion?"
	//229103 "My heart quivers when I visit his tomb in the abbey; I am wracked by fear; it claws at my soul like the talons of demons. Fear, that I will prove them right; that I will disgrace this family’s legacy, as my grandfather did…"
	//229104 "Yet, I must not give in. I will study my father’s reign, and hope that it will imbue me with his strength; the fortitude that I so lack."
	//229105 "My father Edward spent his youth watching in disgust as his ineffectual father Henry drove England to the brink of ruin. When his subjects could bear his ruinous reign no more, a rebellion led by the baron Simon de Montfort deposed Henry, leaving his kingdom in tatters."
	//229106 "After the disastrous Battle of Lewes, the baronial forces captured and jailed my father and grandfather in Hereford. Some kings begin their rise to the throne from within the palace. Edward began his from the anguish of imprisonment."
	//229107 "Yet, even when the future seems bleak, fate occasionally extends its hand and offers allies from the most unlikely of places…"
	//229151 "Like his Norman ancestors, Gilbert de Clare was a shrewd opportunist. Initially a commander in the rebel army, he keenly sensed its divisions and saw that he could further his own ambitions by defecting to Edward."
	//229152 "My father moved with alarming speed. Worcester and Gloucester, Gilbert’s family seat, were seized without delay."
	//229153 "After a string of further victories, he compelled the leaderless and battered rebel forces to capitulate."
	//229154 "Known by many as Longshanks, Edward was feared for his imposing stature and foul temper. While Henry was restored to the throne, all were well aware that Edward was now the true power behind it."
	//
	//229201 "Ruthless and cunning, Edward did not always adhere to the chivalric codes that the European nobility held so dear. After massacring Simon the Younger’s men in a stealthy night attack on Kenilworth, he used the captured banners to disguise his army before smashing de Montfort at Evesham."
	//229202 "In an act of alarming brutality, the corpse of de Montfort, an earl of England, was hacked into carrion and his head mounted on a pike."
	//229203 "Edward had won the war and cowed the rebels into submission in just over a year, but the victory came at the cost of his honor. Nobility and clergy alike cringed at the thought of an impious butcher one day ascending to the throne of England."
	//229204 "To restore his ailing reputation and prove himself worthy of the crown, my father resolved to lead a korståg east to the Holy Land, where the situation grew increasingly dire."
	//229205 "The voracious Mamluk Sultanate waged a fierce war of expansion, first against the Mongoler and now against the beleaguered Korsfarare. Several fortresses quickly fell before their unstoppable onslaught."
	//229206 "Their leader was Sultan Baibars, a man not unlike my father Edward. Originally a slave of Cuman origin, he rose to prominence through military service and had recently taken power after murdering the reigning sultan."
	//229207 "Having just slaughtered the population of Antioch, his armies now threatened Acre and Tripoli from the east, converging on both cities in a suffocating siege. Edward’s army arrived in Acre to find the inhabitants desperate, but not beyond hope."
	//229251 "The fighting was vicious. Droves of Korsfarare and Mamluks alike fell, spattering the battlements and the fields surrounding Acre and Tripoli with blood and gore."
	//229252 "Throughout the Korståg, my father proved his mettle as a tactician and as a statesman. Fearless when faced with peril, he led a daring raid that devastated the enemy towns of Nazareth and Qaqun."
	//229253 "Following these victories, he convinced the terrifying horde of the Mongol Ilkhanate to descend upon the Mamluks, devastating the region around Aleppo."
	//229254 "The hitherto invincible Baibars was overwhelmed and forced to withdraw, but before doing so he sent a Nizari with a poisoned blade to remove his capable rival. Edward slew the assassin, but a wound in his arm left him bedridden for months."
	//
	//229301 "Edward left the Holy Land in an uneasy truce. Baibars had promised to keep the peace for ten years, ten months and ten days; now, with more pressing matters developing back in England, my father could only hope that the Sultan would keep his word."
	//229302 "While Edward was away on Korståg building his reputation as an honorable and capable leader, his father Henry died, leaving him the English crown."
	//229303 "He returned to an England both stable and eagerly anticipating his arrival. On August 19, 1274, the Lord Edward was crowned Edward I of England."
	//229304 "Wishing to expand his new kingdom, Edward set his sights west towards Wales, an old enemy that had supported Simon de Montfort during the baronial rebellion."
	//229305 "The Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffydd constantly antagonized the Anglo-Norman marcher lords on the border. Adding insult to injury, he took Simon de Montfort’s daughter Eleanor as his bride."
	//229306 "My father pounced on the already fractured Welsh factions, seeking to conquer them piece by piece. But if there was one thing that the Welsh princes hated more than each other, it was Englishmen imposing their laws on Welsh territory."
	//229307 "Llywelyn’s brother Dafydd joined the fray and the brothers waged a war of stealth and ambushes, defeating Edward’s southern armies under Luke de Tany and Gilbert de Clare."
	//229308 "Seeing that the hardy folk of these mountainous forests and coarse heaths would not bend easily to his will, my father changed tactics. If the Welsh could not be crushed in open battle, they would be brought to heel from a series of impenetrable castles."
	//229351 "The Welsh fought valiantly, but they were no match for Edward’s wrath. My father’s forces outmaneuvered Llywelyn's forces and smashed them at Orewin Bridge. The Welsh prince fell to the lance of a lone rider, who knew not the importance of the man whom he had slain."
	//229352 "His brother Dafydd was captured at Nanhysglain and declared a traitor to the English crown. Edward pitilessly condemned his bold adversary to be drawn and quartered."
	//229353 "Wales was now firmly in my father’s grip. He bestowed upon me the title of Prince of Wales, which shall be an heirVävstol of my line henceforth."
	//229354 "The network of formidable fortifications that Edward constructed throughout the land shall ensure that the Welsh bow to the English crown for generations to come."
	//
	//229401 "I fear that I am deceiving myself in studying only my father’s achievements in war. As king, I must be both a warrior and a statesman, just as he was."
	//229402 "Drawing inspiration from the legendary stories of King Arthur, Edward grew from a deceitful and duplicitous youth into a pious and chivalrous ruler respected throughout Christendom."
	//229403 "My father implemented economic, administrative and legal reforms that strengthened and stabilized his kingdom. His borrowing of Byzantine concepts led him to be known as 'The English Justinian’."
	//229404 "Yet, to Edward, this was just another part of ruling effectively, and everything that he did furthered his fierce desire to rule over all of Britain. When Alexander III of Scotland died without a male heir, that ambition suddenly seemed within reach."
	//229405 "My father first strove to marry Alexander’s young granddaughter Margaret to me, the heir apparent to England. When she died unexpectedly just a year later, Edward instead installed John Balliol as king in Scotland."
	//229406 "The proud Scots would not suffer themselves to be ruled by an English puppet whose master sought to conscript them into war with France. Instead, they allied themselves with the French and rose in open rebellion."
	//229407 "Edward’s fury was unbridled. If Balliol could not hold his subjects in line, my father would seize Scotland by force."
	//229451 "Father was unspeakably cruel to the Scots. In retribution for an attack on Carlisle, he seized and sacked the wealthy town of Berwick, slaughtering some 20,000 inhabitants."
	//229452 "Balliol, the puppet that Edward had installed as king in Scotland, proved himself a traitor. He marched the Scottish army south against the English, but it was viciously drubbed at the Battle of Dunbar."
	//229453 "Begging for mercy, Balliol capitulated to Edward, who scornfully stripped him of his coat of arms. This disgrace earned him the moniker Toom Tabard, ‘Empty Coat’."
	//229454 "As a final humiliation, Edward seized the Coronation Stone from the monastery in Scone and placed it in a chair in Westminster Abbey. That hallowed Stone of Scone, a symbol of Scottish royalty, shall now sanctify the destiny of an undying line of English kings."
	//
	//229501 "The Scots did not take their humbling well. A year after Balliol’s defeat, they rallied around the fiery riddare William Wallace and poured out of the highlands like rabid wolves."
	//229502 "Wallace was said to be a seven-foot-tall giant who lopped off the heads of horses and men with a five-and-a-half foot sword: a barbaric match for my own ferocious father."
	//229503 "After a string of unexpected victories, Wallace’s rebels were scattered at the Battle of Falkirk and forced into hiding. Like a vengeful spectre, he continued to harry English troops and convoys from the shadows."
	//229504 "Undaunted, Edward and his commander Aymer de Valence approached Stirling Castle. Accompanying them was Robert the Bruce, a Scottish lord sworn to Edward but known to covet the Scottish crown. Keep your friends close but your enemies closer, as the ancient adage goes."
	//229505 "Taking after his famed predecessor Rikard Lejonhjärta, he ordered the construction of a massive set of trebuchets near the walls of Stirling."
	//229506 "His warning to the defenders was simple and dreadful: surrender or face bombardment more ferocious than a rain of hellfire and brimstone."
	//229551 "William Wallace’s body was butchered and his remains were scattered across Scotland as a grim warning to any who might fancy themselves a heroic rebel."
	//229552 "Yet, the effect was the opposite of what my father hoped for. The dying embers of rebellion were kindled into a raging flame as the treacherous Robert the Bruce renounced his vassalage and raised his banners."
	//229553 "With his last war still raging, my father, the mighty king of England and Hammer of the Scots, passed away. England is now mine to rule; his vision mine to fulfill…or to squander."
	//229554 "Robert the Bruce remains a threat and unrest brews throughout England; even my own barons openly show their contempt and demand that my powers be diminished."
	//229555 "I have studied all that my father did, and still the task at hand terrifies me. He faced every adversity and grew to be a great king; yet I already feel my soul buckling under the weight of the crown."
	//229556 "I am king now, but what king shall I be? Should I be deceptive, as my father was in his youth? Should I be the pious and chivalrous administrator? Or brutal to no end, the new Hammer of the Scots?"
	//229557 "How ever can a man become so great as to fulfill all of these roles? I fear that there is no answer."
	//229558 "Even so…when I stand by my father’s tomb, the fear and the shame sometimes sweep aside. Deep within me, I know that, whatever else, I must try. I must fight for my crown, my kingdom, and for my father’s legacy…"
	//229559 "…I will not fail you, father."

	//// 30 - Grand Hertigs
	//
	//230101 "Tomorrow, when Joan of Arc burns at the stake, I want you to watch carefully."
	//230102 "Not the young woman in the flames…but the men who sentenced her to burn."
	//230103 "The English will carry out the sentence; but when nothing but her ashes remains, it is the Grand Hertig of the West, our Hertig of Burgundy, that will have seized a triumph."
	//230104 "For you see, this spectacle is not really about the Maid of Orléans; her death is only as important as the benefit that it brings us. What burns on that pyre is not Joan the person, but La Pucelle: the symbol of the French resistance."
	//230105 "You are young, my son; you have never seen our duchy as anything but a powerful state. But we were not always so mighty. In the greater tale of history, Burgundy is but a newborn power, carved from the lands of the kingdoms and empires that surround us."
	//230106 "Our ascent began with John the Fearless, the father of our current duke. Up until then, the dukes of Burgundy and the Armagnac faction had been equal rivals, fighting for influence at the court of the Mad King of France."
	//230107 "Louis, the leader of the Armagnac faction, had been using the funds of the French crown for years to stifle John in any way possible. He also boasted of having bedded John’s wife..."
	//230108 "Tiring of these insults and Louis’ abuse of royal influence, John decided to end their rivalry for good. Just three years into his reign, he sent fifteen men to stab the Armagnac duke to death on the streets of Paris in broad daylight."
	//230109 "It was a true show of force; in one bloody act, John established himself as the most powerful duke in France."
	//230110 "The Armagnac faction, now leaderless, began preparing for a long war. To keep the Burgunder occupied, they supported a revolt in the city of Liège, which was ruled by John’s brother-in-law, the Hertig of Bavaria."
	//230111 "John the Fearless would not let such unrest spoil his plans for the grand duchy. And so he marched his armies north, to a small village outside Liège called Othée…"
	//230151 "The Battle of Othée was a decisive victory for John the Fearless. He rode in triumph to Paris and his armies entered the city without a fight."
	//230152 "The Armagnac plot had failed. But since they had not openly waged war on him, John could not yet exact his revenge by force."
	//230153 "Instead, John had the 15-year-old son of the deceased duke brought before him. Still mourning the death of his father, the boy was forced to forgive his father’s murderer in public."
	//230154 "A cruel act, you say; and that it was. But remember, my son, that cruelty was not John’s goal, only a means to an end. By orchestrating this public display, John showed not just the boy, but the entire House of Armagnac on their knees, kissing his feet."
	//230155 "It was one insult too many for the proud Armagnacs, and the struggle between the two factions would soon turn into open war."
	//
	//230201 "John the Fearless was now the most powerful man in France. But his rivals, the House of Armagnac, had not been idle."
	//230202 "Now led by the fearsome Count Bernard, they built an alliance against John that included the Hertigs of Orléans and Bourbon and the Count of Alencon. Bernard sent bands of ravaging mercenaries into the lands controlled by John to draw him out."
	//230203 "For John, this was the last straw. He marched his army out of Paris to face the burgeoning alliance. And so France fell head-long into a war that would last for decades."
	//230251 "The Armagnac alliance was broken…for now. But even as he was victorious on one front, John faced a serious setback in Paris. A revolt by the butchers’ guild, which was loyal to Burgundy, had spiraled out of control and the Burgunder and their loyalists were expelled from the city."
	//230252 "John retreated to his domains in Burgundy to regroup, but he would not be able to rest easily."
	//230253 "Across the sea, an old foe of the French had been lying in wait, anticipating the right moment to strike. For Henry V, the king of England, that moment had now come."
	//
	//230301 "In England, they celebrate the Battle of Agincourt as a victory over France. In truth, it was a victory only over the Armagnacs. The Burgunder stayed out of the fight and John eagerly watched as the English king did his work for him, decimating the Armagnac alliance."
	//230302 "Still, the English invasion of France had swiftly turned in Henry’s favor. With the road to Paris now open, he marched his armies towards the French capital."
	//230303 "Sensing his time to strike, John the Fearless rallied his armies. He would race the English to Paris and seize it from the Armagnacs before Henry could arrive."
	//230351 "Paris was now in Burgundian hands, but in seizing the city, John had made an enemy of the English king."
	//230352 "Not wanting to fight both the Armagnacs and the English at the same time, he moved to make peace with his French rivals. The heir to the French throne, the Dauphin, agreed to meet with him on a bridge near Montereau."
	//230353 "John and the Dauphin each arrived with ten of their trusted men and John knelt before the Dauphin as a show of respect; but as he rose, two men of the Dauphin’s retinue, who were Armagnac loyalists, sprung into action and charged John with axes raised."
	//230354 "It was a trap. Before the meeting could even begin, John the Fearless was struck down and killed while the Dauphin only watched unperturbed. It was a fitting end for the man whose career had started with just such an assassination."
	//230355 "The Burgunder were outraged. There would be no peace between the French factions, and Henry V would go on to win many more battles against his fractured enemies."
	//230356 "But while this marks the end of the story of John the Fearless, the tale of Burgundy is not yet over…"
	//
	//230401 "You see, my son; it was not John the Fearless who brought La Pucelle to the stake here in Rouen, but his son: our great duke, Philip the Good."
	//230402 "Until this point, he had been ruling the Burgundian Low Countries in his family’s name, presiding over an economic and cultural golden age in this corner of Europe. Outraged by the murder of his father, he quickly formed an alliance with the English to avenge the death of John the Fearless."
	//230403 "But his war against the Armagnacs would have to wait."
	//230404 "The Hertig of Bavaria, who had fought with John at the Battle of Othée many years before, once more called for help from the Burgunder. This time it was not against an Armagnac revolt, but against his own niece."
	//230405 "Jacqueline of Hainaut was not a woman content with obeying orders. For a short time she had been the queen-to-be of all of France; but when her husband died, she was quickly relegated to her Dutch holdings."
	//230406 "With her claim to the Low Countries contested by the Burgunder, she fled across the English Channel, where she married the Lord Protector of England. Together, they now returned to claim the lands that she had lost to the Hertig of Bavaria."
	//230407 "Philip, seeing his northern realms under attack by an English renegade, rode north to push them back into the sea."
	//230451 "Philip treated his beaten foe with respect. While Jacqueline was a Burgundian only by marriage, her plot, while failed, had been in true Burgundian fashion."
	//230452 "Even so, Jacqueline found her imprisonment in Ghent intolerable."
	//230453 "Not long after her capture, her uncle, the Hertig of Bavaria, was found dead; murdered by poison. It is unclear if Jacqueline was behind this; some have even speculated that Philip himself ordered the assassination..."
	//230454 "But do not let anyone hear you say that, my son."
	//230455 "Regardless, Jacqueline used the ensuing chaos to escape her house arrest. Dressed in men’s clothing, she fled to Holland, forcing Philip to keep his attention in the north."
	//
	//230501 "This is where we will stand tomorrow, my son, when Joan of Arc burns. Already they are dousing the pyre with oil. This is to be no ordinary fire, you see; the flames must rise high for La Pucelle, as if they truly were the fires of Hell."
	//230502 "For a long time she was a nuisance to Hertig Philip. He never could understand her zealous wrath, her single-mindedness…and how she seemed to truly believe the words of fire that she spoke. Compared to him, the ruthless politician, she was another being entirely."
	//230503 "But at this point, La Pucelle was not on Philip’s mind. For even as Joan dealt defeats to the Burgundian forces in France, Philip had yet to deal with the escaped Jacqueline."
	//230504 "In Holland, Jacqueline had found new supporters in the so-called ‘Hooks’, noblemen of low birth. For years, they had been fighting a civil war with the merchant class, known as the ‘Cods’."
	//230505 "Philip now had to walk into this mire of old grudges and blood feuds to finally defeat the elusive Jacqueline."
	//230551 "In the end, it was the Pope that dealt the final blow to Jacqueline’s dreams of power. As he dissolved her marriage to the Lord Protector of England, she was left without allies, and soon she was once again captured by Philip’s forces."
	//230552 "Philip gave her a peace treaty more amicable than she could have hoped for. She was allowed to keep her titles, but Philip assumed regency over all of her lands. Once the wife of the Dauphin of France, Jacqueline was reduced to a position of hollow prestige."
	//230553 "For the first time, the Low Countries were unified under Burgundian rule; a sträckvidd situation, for a land so long defined by quarrelling cities…but, in the end, a change for the better."
	//230554 "You see, my son, a land united is a stronger land. When its cities no longer fight each other, their people can focus on the arts, on industry, beautiful Arkitektur, and innovation…"
	//230555 "All of the things that we call civilization; all of the things that must be cast aside when one is called upon to pick up the sword..."
	//230556 "As for Philip…with his northern realms secured, he could finally turn his attention to France, and to Joan of Arc; the Maid of Orléans."
	//
	//230601 "Since the rise of the Maid of Orléans, the war had not been going well for England and Burgundy."
	//230602 "In a matter of days, Joan had crushed the combined English and Burgundian forces at Orléans; and now, for a year, she had campaigned with the Armagnac army, bringing it victory after victory. Only recently had she suffered a setback, as her forces failed to take Paris from the English."
	//230603 "She was not a warrior; at just nineteen years of age, she carried nothing but a banner into battle. Yet, her tactics and her fiery speeches that seemed to be the very word of God had made her the Armagnacs’ greatest weapon."
	//230604 "Philip resolved to put an end to her for good. His forces were laying siege to Compiègne when word reached him that Joan and her loyal followers had snuck into the city to aid the defenders."
	//230605 "This would be the day that the Maid of Orléans fell."
	//230651 "It was late at night when the soldiers brought Joan to Philip. Calmly, he instructed all of us advisors to leave his tent. As soon as they were alone, La Pucelle began berating the duke to his face."
	//230652 "The Dauphin, she said, was chosen by God to be the savior of France. And he, Hertig Philip, was a traitor to his country."
	//230653 "She was a zealot, as I have told you, my son; for her, the world was black and white. The goals of the Burgundian duke were as incomprehensible to her as her righteous fire was to Philip."
	//230654 "I could see them through a slit in the tent door: the Hertig could barely hide his disgust for this peasant girl who talked down to him as he were a mere commoner. Yet, he retained his composure. When she was finished, he let a long silence fall on the room."
	//230655 "At last, he spoke in a low voice:"
	//230656 "‘If the Dauphin is indeed your beloved savior, Joan, where was he at Paris? Where is he now?’ He did not allow her time to answer."
	//230657 "“The moment that I heard of your capture, I dispatched two emissaries: one to the English and one to your Dauphin, each with the same proposal: 10,000 ducats in return for La Pucelle.’"
	//230658 "‘I am a man of my word, girl. If the Dauphin has not abandoned you and wishes to see you free, I will allow you to return to your holy…mission.’"
	//230659 "‘But, if not…’"
	//230660 "At that moment, two English soldiers entered the tent. With a look almost of pity for the young maiden, Philip nodded. The Englishmen grabbed her by the arms. As they dragged her out, the Hertig sighed and said:"
	//230661 "‘Alas, Joan, it is nothing personal. It is only politics.’"
	//230662 "There she is now; can you see? The English are tying her to the pole. For a short while, this girl was the symbol of French resistance. Now, her death will symbolize the final defeat of the Armagnacs."
	//230663 "Watch, my son: not the girl in the flames, but the men around her: the clerics, the inquisitors, the nobles of England and Burgundy. The men who decide the fate of nations. For them, for us, this is not the burning of a heretic, nor the downfall of a hero."
	//230664 "It is, like all things, a means to an end."

	//// 31 - Hautevilles
	//
	//231101 "'Sit down, my king,' I said to the young Fredrik Roger as he entered the garden. 'It is time for your studies. Your German tutors have no doubt told you of the deeds of your Teutonic grandfather.'"
	//231102 "'I know that story by heart,' the boy king replied proudly."
	//231103 "'Indeed,' I said with a wink, 'but I will tell you of the other side of your family – for you are firstly a son of Sicily.'"
	//231104 "'Ah, dear Sicily, a kingdom like no other: where three peoples were fused under the southern sun and formed the jewel that lies between East and West.'"
	//231105 "'It was the Norman side of your family that made it all possible. Normandy was a cold, northern land of steel and chivalry. But it was also overflowing with the younger sons of minor barons – men aspiring to a greatness that exceeded the constraints of birth and station.'"
	//231106 "'This story–your story–begins with your great grandfather's brother, Robert de Hauteville: a man of immense stature, with fair hair, broad shoulders, and eyes that all but shot out sparks of flame.'"
	//231107 "'Robert was driven and possessed that incorrigible confidence that melts away doubts and allows ambition to keep pace with imagination. More cunning than any foe he faced, he was ever-vigilant to seize any advantage, win through any means, and remain unbound by the rules of lesser men.'"
	//231108 "'You speak of him as a great man…but what did he do?' the boy king asked, his eyes now wide with childish enthusiasm. I answered: 'Robert was the first to unite all Italian Normans under a single ruler, but his origins were very humble.'"
	//231109 "'He came from Normandy to Italy with scarcely thirty followers and sought fortune in this land that so often rewards those with the daring and brilliance to seize it…'"
	//231151 "'The Italienare called Robert, 'Guiscard': the cunning fox. In a few decades, he had brought all of Southern Italy to heel, but his imagination and his cunning would carry him across the horizon to new conquests.'"
	//231152 "'Where did he go next?' The boy king nearly jumped up as he asked."
	//231153 "'That is a story for tomorrow…not even a king can learn all of history in a single day.'"
	//231154 "I remained in the garden as young Fredrik Roger hurried off, a smile resting on my face. Already I could see in him the shadow of his forefathers. Perhaps, one day, this boy would eclipse them all."
	//
	//231201 "'Stories of Robert's successes in Italy inspired a Normandy broken by civil war. The Norman Hertig William had not yet earned the title 'The Conqueror' and was still a controversial young bastard barely clinging to power. Many Norman riddare, bloodied by civil war and lured by southern riches, set out for Italy.'"
	//231202 "'Robert's youngest brother–your great grandfather–Roger de Hauteville, was among them, but he was different. Where Robert was ruthless and cunning, Roger was patient and chivalrous. He was motivated by love.'"
	//231203 "'Judith d'Evreux, cousin of Hertig William, had stolen Roger's heart and the two wished to be married. Judith's father, however, would never entertain the thought of his daughter marrying a mere landless riddare.'"
	//231204 "'Roger had no choice but to go to Italy to prove himself worthy of the woman that he loved.'"
	//231205 "'But Robert Guiscard, like his brother before him, expected Roger to make his own way in Italy, as he had done years before. He offered Roger no lands and no riddare.'"
	//231206 "'Fortunately for Roger, there was still a prize awaiting a man of his talents. An island–ruled by Muslims for two centuries, but now divided between rival emirs–Sicily beckoned.'"
	//231251 "'Sicily was a land fitting for a man like Roger: daring and ambitious, but also patient, chivalric, tolerant, and, above all, motivated by love. He married his beloved Judith and settled in a Sicilian court.'"
	//231252 "'Roger Bosso–the Great Count, as your great grandfather would come to be known–was more than a conqueror. Adopting the ways of the island, he fashioned a new eclecticism that gave Sicily its unique character and strength.'"
	//231253 "'I do not know these words,' the boy king said sadly."
	//231254 "'Forgive me, my king. What it means…is that the warm Mediterranean breezes, the cool marble colonnades, the bubbly fountains splashing among the lemon trees…these are marked on your soul.'"
	//231255 "'You are shaped by this land where Catholic church bells and the Orthodox liturgy mingle seamlessly with the Islamic call to prayer. It is a heritage unlike any other, all thanks to your great grandfather.'"
	//231256 "The boy nodded. I did not think he could yet fathom just how unique his kingdom was…"
	//
	//231301 "'What did my great grandfather do next?' asked the boy king."
	//231302 "'I know that you want to hear more of Count Roger, my young king, but there are many lessons to learn from the other Hautevilles.'"
	//231303 "'While your great grandfather was uniting Sicily, Robert Guiscard looked east to a Byzantine Empire reeling from its crushing defeat at Manzikert. He arranged for an Orthodox monk to claim that he was a deposed emperor in need of Guiscard's support.'"
	//231304 "'Guiscard recognized, however, that he could not devote his full attention to such a campaign. The ceaseless feuds between Pope and Holy Roman Emperor would inevitably draw him back to Italy. He therefore assigned the command of the expedition to his eldest son, Bohemond.'"
	//231305 "'Twenty years before, when Bohemond had been a boy, Guiscard discarded Bohemond's mother to marry a local Lombard princess for a momentary advantage. The first marriage to Bohemond's mother was ruled invalid by a compliant Pope, reducing Bohemond to a bastard.'"
	//231306 "'By tradition, nothing of Guiscard's would pass to Bohemond, but this obstacle only hardened the warrior prince. He had all of the individual heroism, tactical brilliance, and religious conviction to inspire men to follow him to the ends of the earth and challenge even an emperor.'"
	//231307 "'What Bohemond had not accounted for, however, was the power of a woman.'"
	//231351 "'Robert Guiscard died suddenly in 1085 while Bohemond was stricken by illness, or, as some say, poisoned by his step-mother Sikelgaita.'"
	//231352 "'Believing that Bohemond might die, the Norman lords had no choice but to elect Sikelgaita's son as duke, a decision further encouraged by Count Roger of Sicily's support for the weaker and more easily influenced second son of Robert Guiscard.'"
	//231353 "'The seeds of Count Roger's patience were beginning to take root, but Bohemond's story is not yet finished.'"
	//
	//231401 "'Bohemond never forgave Count Roger for siding with his younger brother, but other events would draw Bohemond away before he could threaten Norman unity.'"
	//231402 "'As bands of riddare and foot soldiers passed through Sicily on their way to the Holy Land, Roger arranged for Bohemond to linger amongst them.'"
	//231403 "'Lured by the promises of lands and eternal glory on Korståg, Bohemond, too, set out for the east. '"
	//231404 "'Bohemond re-traced the path through the Byzantine Empire that he had taken only a few years before while warring against the Emperor Alexios Komnenos. Now, however, he came to Constantinople as an honored guest, kneeling before his old adversary and promising to restore the Empire's territories in the Holy Land.'"
	//231405 "'Bohemond, of course, shared his father's cunning, and had no intention of following through with such a promise. When the Korsfarare besieged the ancient city of Antioch, Bohemond resolved that it should be his.'"
	//231406 "'Mustering the cunning of his heritage, Bohemond told the emperor's men that the other Korsfarare planned to assassinate them, causing them to return home.'"
	//231407 "'He then bribed a local garrison commander to open Antioch's gates, but only after he had secured the sworn promises of the other Korsfarare princes that the first among them to enter the city would rule it.'"
	//231408 "'Unfortunately for Bohemond and Korsfararna, a great Turkish army was on its way. Already worn down by eight long months of siege, Bohemond would need every ounce of his courage and his skill to survive.'"
	//231451 "'While Bohemond did not inherit his father's lands, he did inherit his attributes and these won him a princedom.'"
	//231452 "'But Bohemond was not done after conquering Antioch. He sought every opportunity to conquer new lands, but his fearless aggression led to him being ambushed and captured by the Turkar.'"
	//231453 "'His old enemy, the Emperor Alexios Komnenos, even offered to pay Bohemond's ransom if the Norman prince was brought to Constantinople in chains. Once again, Bohemond bested his old enemy, tricking his Turkish captors into releasing him for a smaller ransom.'"
	//231454 "'Years later, Bohemond again fought against the emperor, but was surrounded by the emperor's armies. He agreed to become a vassal of Emperor Alexios, but Bohemond's cunning had one last triumph.'"
	//231455 "'So that the treaty binding Bohemond to the emperor would not include Antioch, Bohemond never again set foot in the city. He died in Sicily, leaving his son to succeed him in his hard-won eastern princedom.'"
	//
	//231501 "'Our story is coming nearly to an end, my young king, but I have not yet even told you of your grandfather, he who first wore the crown that now rests upon your head.'"
	//231502 "'It is a story that should sound familiar to you. Your grandfather's father, the great Count Roger, died when Roger II was only a boy. Like you, he was raised by his mother in a cosmopolitan court, among Greek and Muslim tutors.'"
	//231503 "'While such an upbringing meant that the young Roger lacked the martial confidence of his forebears, he instead gained skills for diplomacy and statecraft that would prove far more valuable.'"
	//231504 "'At that time, Norman Italy was divided into two lordships: Apulia, ruled by Robert Guiscard's grandson; and Sicily, ruled by Roger. When his cousin in Apulia died childless in 1127, Roger claimed all Hauteville lands in Italy, forming the united Kingdom of Sicily.'"
	//231505 "'But this growing power–and Roger's tolerance for peoples of all Tros–raised the suspicions of the Pope. Railing against the 'half-heathen prince,' the Pope called a Korståg.'"
	//231506 "'Roger's Norman vassals, led by his own brother-in-law, rose in rebellion, while a mighty German army headed by the Holy Roman Emperor himself marched down the length of Italy.'"
	//231507 "'But Roger had grander ambitions than fighting Normans and German princes. He had a kingdom to build.'"
	//231551 "'Poets, scientists, and artists came to Sicily from both the Islamic and Christian worlds, welcomed with admiration and tolerance. The long gestating seeds of Count Roger's patience, planted in this most fertile soil, had finally awoken and flowered under King Roger and this bright kingdom in the sun.'"
	//231552 "'As for the Holy Roman Emperor, he died in the mountains on his way back to Germany. His throne stood empty for many years, though his grandson, styling himself Henry the Lion, would lay claim to it.'"
	//231553 "'Ultimately, it was your German grandfather who finally restored the Holy Roman Empire and united Germany and Italy.'"
	//231554 "'You see, my dear Fredrik Roger, in your name, you carry the legacies of both of your grandfathers. One, whom your German tutors adore, was, of course, the great Fredrik Barbarossa.'"
	//231555 "'But the other–half-Norman, half-Italian, but fully Sicilian–was most like you.'"
	//231556 "'And that, my young king, is the story of how your family built the kingdom that you now rule.'"
	//231557 "The young king watched me for a moment. He stood up, thanked me for the lecture, and walked away. About halfway through the garden, he stopped and stood silent for a while, and then asked thoughtfully:"
	//231558 "'Do you think…that I will be their equal? A new Guiscard, or Roger Bosso, or King Roger?'"
	//231559 "'My king,' I said, 'in time, you will outshine them all.'"
